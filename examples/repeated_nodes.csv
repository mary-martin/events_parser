support," While opinion polls show Saied's moves have widespread support , his long delay in declaring a timeline out of the crisis has started to cement opposition to him. The exception is likely a lack of support among those who identify closely with Ennahda and Qalb Tounes, as well as some members of the political elite.

Despite many political parties opposing his latest moves, Saeed is mainly counting on the ""huge popular support that he has till today,"" he added. Large crowds poured into the streets in support , reflecting growing anger at the moderate Islamist Ennahda party - the biggest party in parliament - and the government over chronic economic malaise. Saied, with 73 percent of the vote in the 2019 presidential run-off elections and visible support for his July 25 emergency actions, seems to be popular across different social segments, though more research is needed on this point. And Saied may not need to resort to repression since he entered office with widespread support . Recent polling suggests Saied's decisions enjoy broad popularity, and this appears to be true in Sidi Hassine where nearly all those Meshkal spoke with expressed their support and said they see it as an opportunity to get rid of a corrupt political elite. Recent polling suggests Saied's decisions enjoy broad popularity, and this appears to be true in Sidi Hassine where nearly all those Meshkal spoke with expressed their support and said they see it as an opportunity to get rid of a corrupt political elite.

The historical moments of the session can be called those when representatives of the opposition and the Popular Front arrived at the meeting. Yet to understand something of the causes and dynamics of the conflict , it is important to look briefly at the country's human and physical geography and its history, as well as its position in the larger geopolitical dynamics of the region in the early and mid-1990s. Freedom of Expression  The government severely restricts freedom of expression. In September 1994, the government and the UTO agreed to a ceasefire brokered by the U.N. In 1998, there was a major shootout in downtown Dushanbe after three members of the opposition were arrested.. Government forces used tanks and artillery to drive the rebels into the hills. The government broke down. Therefore, there were few representatives of the opposition , five people. A few hours later, an armed clash took place in the Bokhtar district of the Kurgan-Tube region. The fifth round opened in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, at the start of December 1995 with Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov calling on the warring factions to share a dinner table and eat the ""plov of peace."" Individual countries and international organizations would continue to help Tajikistan in the years that followed to help alleviate the damage done to the country during the civil war and prevent the conflict from returning. I already foresaw that if this does not happen, then the opposition forces will cross the border, leave for Afghanistan and the war will continue anyway, I foresaw. This gallery shows the rise of political tensions, the victims of the conflict , and the push for peace. In August 1996, opposition troops moved close to Dushanbe amid intensified fighting that ended yet another cease -fire agreement. In the months that followed, the Rahmonov government negotiated with the United Tajikistan Opposition to reintegrate the political and military organizations of the two sides. A power-sharing organization, the National Reconciliation Commission, was set up with the head of the United Tajik Opposition , Sayid Abdulloh Nuri, as its leader. Since the treaty was signed there have been periodic skirmishes between government forces and renegade militia groups and continuing attempts (occasionally successful) to assassinate political opponents. The opposition was given 30 percent of the seats in the coalition government. Kirill Nourzhanov and Christian Bleuer wrote: ""At the beginning of the conflict the issue of regional identities being politicised was readily apparent, with Kulobi Tajiks dominant in pro-government demonstrations and Gharmi Tajiks heavily over-represented in the religious wing of the opposition . Most Russian citizens in Tajikistan left early in the war . The Tajik peace talks in Ashgabat would not conclude until July 1996, and in between January and July Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Russia Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov made separate trips to Ashgabat in an attempt to keep negotiations going. *  End of the Tajikistan Civil War  The Tajikistan civil war ended with a peace accord in June 1997 that came about after Russian troops helped put down the rebels and Russian diplomats and Rahmon's commanders pressured Rahmon and the neo-Communists to negotiate with the rebels, offer a general amnesty and adopt a new constitution. Kirill Nourzhanov and Christian Bleuer wrote: ""At the beginning of the conflict the issue of regional identities being politicised was readily apparent, with Kulobi Tajiks dominant in pro-government demonstrations and Gharmi Tajiks heavily over-represented in the religious wing of the opposition .

"" But in the end Russia sided with the neo-Communist because it had ties to the old Soviet leadership in Tajikistan and the Russian army and it worried about links between the Garmis and Muslim extremists. Fighting After the End of the Civil War  After the 1997 peace accord, the rebels kept a base only 32 kilometers outside of Dushanbe. Kirill Nourzhanov and Christian Bleuer wrote: ""At the beginning of the conflict the issue of regional identities being politicised was readily apparent, with Kulobi Tajiks dominant in pro-government demonstrations and Gharmi Tajiks heavily over-represented in the religious wing of the opposition.

Moscow, 23 June 1997 (RFE/RL) - The United Tajik Opposition has again warned that it may not sign a peace accord with the Tajik government, planned for later this month, unless certain demands are met. In December 1996, Rahmon traveled to Khostdekh in northern Afghanistan to meet face-to-face with UTO leader Said Abdullo Nuri.

WATCH: Twenty Years Later: The Tajik Civil War And Its Aftermath  The first round of talks between the Tajik government and battlefield opponents the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) took place in Moscow in April 1994 after some shuttle diplomacy by Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamshin, who had been traveling between Dushanbe and Tehran, where the UTO leadership was based. Last week the UTO sent a letter to Annan saying it would boycott the signing ceremony unless there was an exchange of war prisoners, and a clarification of the posts to be offered to the opposition in a future government. ><  The so-called Islamic forces, or Muslim rebels, consisted of Muslim extremists, moderate Muslims, intellectuals, democrats and Tajik clans and warlords—primarily from Garm and Gorno-Badakhshan—that opposed the government. Many different lines of affiliation shaped the configuration of forces in the conflict , however, and both sides were divided over substantive political issues. This epilogue will provide a brief overview and short analysis of the most important phase of the civil war: from the outbreak of violence to the military victory of the anti-opposition Popular Front forces in December 1992 and the arrival in the capital of Tajikistan's new leader, Emomali Rahmon. Soon it was clear that the real players in the conflict were the Kulobi Tajik militias allied to local Uzbeks and militias from Hisor on one side against the IRP's mullahs and their Gharmi Tajik followers allied to Gharmi-dominated Dushanbe street gangs and Pamiri police officers and militias on the other."" Legalizing religion-based political parties was one of the major concessions made by the government in the peace negotiations , and the IRP plays a role, though marginal, in the nation's political life. But in the end Russia sided with the neo-Communist because it had ties to the old Soviet leadership in Tajikistan and the Russian army and it worried about links between the Garmis and Muslim extremists. But higher officials from both sides attended the second and third round of talks, showing they were gaining in importance. As the war progressed, some of these groups united in the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) to further their military effort and to participate in peace negotiations. If they left, that would be the end of Tajikistan. The SRSG was asked by reporters about the reaction of the President since he'd just returned from meeting him. Instead the conflict in Tajikistan had the classic dynamics of a civil war in which different interest groups mobilised to contest control of the state and its resources, as well as the principles upon which the newly independent country would be based: secular or Islamic, 'democratic' or authoritarian. On June 27, Tajikistan marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Tajik Peace Accord that ended a five-year civil war there. The conflict was the culmination of a power struggle between a communist-led government that was dominated by people from Leninabad (known as ""Leninabadis""), and an opposition coalition that drew support primarily from people whose origins were from the northeast (""Gharmis"") and Gorno-Badakhshan (""Pamiris""). The agreement called for a National Reconciliation Council that would be a forum to negotiate the terms of a permanent peace. The rebels fought under the leadership of Islamic Renaissance Party and numbered around 5,000. Their presence was largely supported by the local population because they helped to end the war and kept violence from flaring up. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) said it will send a representative to Friday's signing ceremony in Moscow. Pro -Communist Kulyabs rulers were installed in January 1993. Mission of Observers to Tajikistan (UNMOT) was established to monitor the ceasefire . This regional factor was to increase steadily as the level of violence increased throughout southern Tajikistan in the summer and autumn of 1992. This would apply also to ethnicity in the case of Uzbeks and Pamiris, who came to be identified with the ' pro -government' and opposition sides, respectively. The general peace agreement in 1997, which really stopped the war , can be called historical. This would apply also to ethnicity in the case of Uzbeks and Pamiris, who came to be identified with the 'pro- government ' and opposition sides, respectively. Moscow, 23 June 1997 (RFE/RL) - The United Tajik Opposition has again warned that it may not sign a peace accord with the Tajik government , planned for later this month, unless certain demands are met. After the collapse of the USSR, according to an agreement signed in Tashkent in 1992, the Belarusian army was to cut its stocks of conventional weapons by half, retaining only 1,800 tanks, 2,600 infantry fighting vehicles, 1,615 pieces of artillery, 260 fighters and 80 helicopters. In December 1996, Rahmon traveled to Khostdekh in northern Afghanistan to meet face-to-face with UTO leader Said Abdullo Nuri. Many different lines of affiliation shaped the configuration of forces in the conflict , however, and both sides were divided over substantive political issues. In the campaign, apparently coordinated with Moscow, Tajikistani troops moved with Russian air support eastward into the country's narrow central corridor toward opposition strongholds. This year, the Tajik government did not hold any public events to celebrate National Unity Day, which commemorates the signing of the peace accord. In the ceremony -- attended by all UN staff in Dushanbe as well as delegations from the countries of the deceased and friends from the international community and Tajik society -- the SRSG said a last farewell on behalf of all UNMOT members to our loved colleagues. A cease -fire had been declared in 1996. Arbob-92: how the fratricidal war began in Tajikistan (deputy K. Khasanov recalls)  10:36 15.11.2007 Arbob-92: how it was  The fratricidal war that began in the summer and autumn of 1992 brought incalculable disasters, the death of many innocent people. The main warring factions were composed of political groups allied with people capable of mobilising armed militias, often through regional affiliations. June 27 marked the 24th anniversary of the signing of the UN-brokered Tajik Peace Accord that ended a five-year civil war between Tajikistan's secular government and a coalition of opposition groups led by Islamic forces. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) said it will send a representative to Friday's signing ceremony in Moscow. It is known that before signing the Armistice Protocol with the leaders of the opposition, he agreed to an amnesty for persons who had committed even serious crimes. A peace process , led by the UN and with considerable participation from foreign countries, resulted in a political and military settlement centred on a power-sharing formula codified in the June 1997 General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan. 1, 1994)  Costs of the Tajik Civil War  By some estimates the Tajikistan civil war between 1992 and 1997 left between 65,000 and 150,000 dead, which works to about one or two percent of the entire population of Tajikistan. The previous day an official UNMOT delegation comprising military and civilian members took part in the remembrance and burial ceremony of their loved colleague, Jorajon Mahramov. But the war went on for another five years...  And then I suggested that all the opposing factions lay down their arms. In December Rahmonov signed a peace agreement with Sayed Abdullo Nuri, leader of the opposition Islamic Rebirth Party. TAJIKISTAN CIVIL WAR In 1992 a short-lived coalition government broke down, sending the country into a civil war that was won nominally when the old guard forces captured Dushanbe and named Imomali Rahmonov chief executive. * End of the Tajikistan Civil War  The Tajikistan civil war ended with a peace accord in June 1997 that came about after Russian troops helped put down the rebels and Russian diplomats and Rahmon's commanders pressured Rahmon and the neo-Communists to negotiate with the rebels, offer a general amnesty and adopt a new constitution. During the negotiations , it was about the release of the chairman of the Kurgan-Tyube regional executive committee Aslonov. Last week the UTO sent a letter to Annan saying it would boycott the signing ceremony unless there was an exchange of war prisoners, and a clarification of the posts to be offered to the opposition in a future government. Emomali Rakhmonov, after being elected chairman of the Supreme Council, actively joined in the leadership of the republic. The main zone of violent conflict was the economically significant Vakhsh Valley of southern Tajikistan, a few hours' drive south of the capital, Dushanbe. WATCH: Twenty Years Later: The Tajik Civil War And Its Aftermath  The first round of talks between the Tajik government and battlefield opponents the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) took place in Moscow in April 1994 after some shuttle diplomacy by Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamshin, who had been traveling between Dushanbe and Tehran, where the UTO leadership was based. A second round of talks were held in Tehran in September 1994; and a third round in Islamabad in late October and early November of that year -- both rounds resulting in agreements for cease -fires that never took hold. At that time, the Deputy Prime Minister, the late Khabibullo Saidmuradov, entered the podium and stated that ""...acting  Prime Minister and other members of the government will attend the session on November 17."" Rahmonov won a decisive victory in the presidential election of 1994, with opposition only from a second hard-line politician of similar background, in what was generally labeled a rigged outcome. t Contact Group Condemns the Brutal Murders  Members of the Contact Group met on July 23 and strongly condemned what they described as the organisers and perpetrators of this ruthless crime and asked the Government of Tajikistan and the UTO to make immediate efforts to identify the murderers. The political leadership of the opposition and central government had very little, if any, control over the people apparently fighting in their name. The meeting was attended by the personal representative of the UN Secretary General, UN employee Colonel Duval, Russia's representative to the UN V. Goryachev, Vice President of Kyrgyzstan F. Kulov, First Deputy Foreign Ministers of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ambassador of the Russian Federation M. Senkevich. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) said it will send a representative to Friday's signing ceremony in Moscow.

In response, Iskandarov replied that he had signed a letter of resignation and had the right to lead the session until the issue of the resignation of the Presidium of the Supreme Council was considered and suggested that the acting chief prosecutor give a legal assessment of the proposal of the conciliation commission.

The five-year civil war that ended in 1997 led to the deaths of more than 150,000 people and saw over one-tenth of the Tajik population flee the country. Soon it was clear that the real players in the conflict were the Kulobi Tajik militias allied to local Uzbeks and militias from Hisor on one side against the IRP's mullahs and their Gharmi Tajik followers allied to Gharmi-dominated Dushanbe street gangs and Pamiri police officers and militias on the other."" On June 27, Tajikistan marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Tajik Peace Accord that ended a five-year civil war there. *  As the civil war continued, the Rahmonov regime took steps to avoid internal sources of opposition .

Peace Talks in the Tajikistan Civil War in 1996  In April 1994, peace talks arranged by the United Nations (UN) began between the post-civil war government in Dushanbe and members of the exiled opposition . Russian air attacks on opposition villages in south-central Tajikistan contravened a three-month extension of the UN-sponsored cease -fire (originally signed in 1994). The leadership of the IRP, despite their pretentions to being a party for all (Sunni) Muslims, was heavily staffed by Tajiks with roots in one particular region. For example, on November 23, Emomali Rakhmonov said at the session that on Sunday, November 22, he traveled to the Shaartuz region, which borders Uzbekistan, met with the field commanders of the Pyanj, Kumsangir regions, who agreed to come to the session, including Sangak Safarov. But the representative will not sign the National Reconciliation Accord unless other earlier demands are met. The opposition was given 30 percent of the seats in the coalition government.

Although the new constitution approved in November 1994 contained substantial guarantees of human rights (also staples of all the Soviet-era constitutions), prescribed legislative and review functions for the legislature, and mandated an independent judiciary, in fact the country's governance amounted to one-man rule based on declarations of emergency executive powers extended from 1993 and 1994. As a result of the cease fire, the UN established an observer mission in Tajikistan, which had a staff of forty-three in early 1996. Talks in Ashgabat resumed on January 29, 1996, but the government's new chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov, said negotiations were near collapse. A special United Nations ceremony was held on Friday 24 July at UNMOT's headquarters in Dushanbe to honor men who had, with the most dignified human values, given their lives for the cause of peace in a foreign land miles away from their family and loved ones. The conflict was the culmination of a power struggle between a communist-led government that was dominated by people from Leninabad (known as ""Leninabadis""), and an opposition coalition that drew support primarily from people whose origins were from the northeast (""Gharmis"") and Gorno-Badakhshan (""Pamiris""). ><  ""As the demonstrations intensified and eventually turned to violence , political and social authorities who could not quickly mobilise manpower for violent conflict became powerless. The fifth round opened in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, at the start of December 1995 with Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov calling on the warring factions to share a dinner table and eat the ""plov of peace."" The Right to Monitor    Helsinki Watch and Memorial attempted to visit four journalists who had reportedly been beaten in prison in Tajikistan. The pro-Communist Tajikistan government was armed with tanks, armored personnel carriers and weapons and supplies brought in on Russian supply lines and logistical support. Russia stepped in and put pressure on the Tajik government . Following Ambassador Strobe Talbott's visit to Tajikistan, the State Department reported that the ambassador's delegation had had ""serious discussions with President Rakhmonov on the need for political reconciliation within Tajikistan. At the end of his speech, he said that in order to stabilize the socio-political situation, to stop the fratricidal war, he decided to resign and asked to consider the issue of his pension provision and other benefits previously established for the President.

The Russians provided the Tajikistan government with heavy weaponry, manpower and money. TAJIKISTAN Human Rights Developments    Following the government's victory in the civil war against an alliance consisting of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan (DPT) and the Islamic Revival Party (IRP), Tajikistan became a human rights disaster area. All this caused concern not only among the residents of Tajikistan, but also among the entire public and the leaders of neighboring countries, the Russian Federation, who were actively involved in the process of helping Tajikistan to stop the fratricidal war and create normal conditions for the work of state bodies.

On June 27, Tajikistan marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Tajik Peace Accord that ended a five-year civil war there. Peace Talks in the Tajikistan Civil War in 1996  In April 1994, peace talks arranged by the United Nations (UN) began between the post-civil war government in Dushanbe and members of the exiled opposition . On behalf of the parliamentary conciliation commission, deputy K. Turaev suggested that since the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet had resigned in its entirety, it would be expedient to lead the session to one of the deputies. Kuibyshev between pro-communist Tajiks of Kulyab origin living in the village of Sari Pul-1, and supporters of the opposition of Garm origin - people from the village of Sari Pul-2. A breakthrough in negotiations followed the Taliban capture of Kabul in 1996, which alarmed all Central Asian governments and, significantly, Russia, a key actor in Tajikistan and mediator in the peace negotiations. As a result of the cease fire, the UN established an observer mission in Tajikistan, which had a staff of forty-three in early 1996. Meanwhile, on November 5-7, Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council A. Saidov met with the leaders of the warring factions in the Pyanj region. Then, in a long procession of over fifty UN vehicles, more than four hundred people who had attended the ceremony accompanied the coffins to Dushanbe Airport from where the bodies were sent in a UN airplane to their countries of origin: Poland, Uruguay and Japan. Also attending were representatives of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (known as the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe until December 1994), and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Elections in November 1993 and a new constitution establishing a presidential system, approved by a referendum on November 6, 1994, again did little to diffuse the situation as the opposition refused to participate. The civil war in Tajikistan gave the leaders in other Central Asian nations an excuse to crack down on Islamic extremists in their own country. There was fighting, violence and instability after the peace accord was signed. The government has arrested scores of members of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), an Islamic group that supports the reestablishment of the Caliphate, or Islamic state, for Muslims by peaceful means. As the conflict worsened, leaders of the militias emerged—very few of them familiar to those outside their home areas. The opposition at that time simply surrendered its positions. Last week the UTO sent a letter to Annan saying it would boycott the signing ceremony unless there was an exchange of war prisoners, and a clarification of the posts to be offered to the opposition in a future government. The peace agreement brokered by the United Nations between the government and the opposition called for both sides to merge, with members of both sides serving in the cabinet. Deputy Secretary of State Steven Pifer, who met with Belarusian Defense Minister Leonid Maltsev, Foreign Minister Mikhail Khvostov and other officials, also claimed that the Belarusian military in Belarus is training Iraqis to operate S-300 missile systems. In the months that followed, the Rahmonov government negotiated with the United Tajikistan Opposition to reintegrate the political and military organizations of the two sides. A power-sharing organization, the National Reconciliation Commission, was set up with the head of the United Tajik Opposition , Sayid Abdulloh Nuri, as its leader. They were led by the warlord Sanjak Safarov, who had spent 23 years in prison on murder charges.He launched an ethnic cleansing campaign directed at anyone from the Garm or Kurgan Tyube valleys. Tajikistan: Opposition Warns It May Not Sign Peace Accord  Moscow, 23 June 1997 (RFE/RL) - The United Tajik Opposition has again warned that it may not sign a peace accord with the Tajik government, planned for later this month, unless certain demands are met. On June 27, Tajikistan marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Tajik Peace Accord that ended a five-year civil war there. But higher officials from both sides attended the second and third round of talks, showing they were gaining in importance. Most of the last remaining holdouts in Pamir region laid down their weapons when the Aga Khan visited and September 1998 and encouraged the people of Gorno-Badakhshan to make peace with the government . It was also alleged that at the end of 1998, Belarus, bypassing UN sanctions, sold to Saddam Hussein's regime another batch of high-tech equipment for the production of optical devices.

(See Chronology for a narrative of the unfolding war and peace processes.) *  As the civil war continued, the Rahmonov regime took steps to avoid internal sources of opposition . Fighting After the End of the Civil War  After the 1997 peace accord, the rebels kept a base only 32 kilometers outside of Dushanbe. Elections in November 1993 and a new constitution establishing a presidential system, approved by a referendum on November 6, 1994, again did little to diffuse the situation as the opposition refused to participate. The rebels fought under the leadership of Islamic Renaissance Party and numbered around 5,000.

Individual countries and international organizations would continue to help Tajikistan in the years that followed to help alleviate the damage done to the country during the civil war and prevent the conflict from returning. SRSG Meets the President of Tajikistan:  First thing on Wednesday morning, 22 July, the SRSG, Mr Jan Kubiš, met President Imomali Rahmanov to discuss the gravity of the situation for the United Nations Mission of Observers to Tajikistan. Hoja Akbar Turajonzoda, the First Deputy Chairman of the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT), the backbone of the UTO, led the opposition 's delegation. I think that everyone who went there believed that we would stop the war . At the height of the conflict there were around 25,000 Russian troops — 17,000 border guards and 8,000 peacekeepers — in Tajikistan. This epilogue will provide a brief overview and short analysis of the most important phase of the civil war: from the outbreak of violence to the military victory of the anti- opposition Popular Front forces in December 1992 and the arrival in the capital of Tajikistan's new leader, Emomali Rahmon. And at the end of September 1996, the Taliban captured Kabul and continued driving northward, to areas where the UTO had established bases and where tens of thousands of refugees from Tajikistan were sheltering. From early December 1992 through February1993 the Tajikistan government, led by Emomali Rakhmonov, presided over an extraordinarily ruthless campaign of revenge against individuals believed to have supported or sympathized with the DPT-IRP coalition, which had governed Tajikistan for six months in 1992. It is difficult to say anything definite about how the behind-the-scenes negotiations between the deputies representing the opposing sides of the conflict took place, in view of the fact that journalists were not invited to them. The government was supported in the civil war by people from Kuliab (""Kuliabis),"" a district in the southern Khatlon province. According to eyewitnesses interviewed by the Moscow-based human rights group Memorial and Helsinki Watch, Popular Front soldiers and other pro -government forces stopped buses and trolley buses, stopped people on streets, and deployed forces at the Dushanbe airport in order to check individuals' documents. Ashur Ashurov, an active participant in the Second World War, Honored Lawyer of the Republic, Chairman of the Dushanbe City Court, said: “I was looking forward to this session, because lawlessness has reached its most extreme degree and it’s time to put an end to it. After the end of the session, journalists of the republic conducted a survey of well-known politicians, honored people of the republic on the topic ""The session passed: how will we live on?"". Also, as political and criminal violence worsened, the country became increasingly impoverished, and corruption, drug-trafficking and hostage-taking rose sharply. Tajikistan has since at least 1997 facilitated the transport of Russian and Iranian military supplies to the United Front opposition in Afghanistan, in particular via airports in Dushanbe and Kuliab. June 27 marked the 24th anniversary of the signing of the UN-brokered Tajik Peace Accord that ended a five-year civil war between Tajikistan's secular government and a coalition of opposition groups led by Islamic forces. The most significant result was a cease -fire agreement that took effect in October 1994.

Tajikistan: Opposition Warns It May Not Sign Peace Accord  Moscow, 23 June 1997 (RFE/RL) - The United Tajik Opposition has again warned that it may not sign a peace accord with the Tajik government, planned for later this month, unless certain demands are met. Indeed, Russia appeared to have no publicly stated human rights agenda in Tajikistan, and Russian government officials spoke out only once against human rights violations in Tajikistan. In the campaign, apparently coordinated with Moscow, Tajikistani troops moved with Russian air support eastward into the country's narrow central corridor toward opposition strongholds. Moscow, 23 June 1997 (RFE/RL) - The United Tajik Opposition has again warned that it may not sign a peace accord with the Tajik government, planned for later this month, unless certain demands are met. However, Tajikistan has since banned the Islamic Renaissance Party that was officially registered during the peace process . Aside from the deaths of combatants and numerous unarmed civilians, the conflict generated a massive number of refugees and internally displaced persons, led to large-scale destruction and looting of property, resulted in the rape and torture of many, and further harmed the already fragile economy while devastating the livelihoods of many in Tajikistan. When the power struggles in Dushanbe led to civil unrest and violent conflict , national-level elites and local powerbrokers mobilised support from the local level, drawing on and appealing to ties of identity, shared economic concerns and common security dilemmas.

First Phase of the Tajikistan Civil War in 1992  The Kulyabis launched a scorched earth offensive in the Garm and Kurgan-Tyube valleys. The United Tajik Opposition (UTO) was an amalgam of nationalist and Islamist parties and movements. In Qurghonteppa this resulted in competition between Gharmi Tajiks who backed the opposition and Kulobi Tajiks who backed the government and worked against the reforms. Toward the end of March, however, the government expelled many of the 30,000 to 40,000 refugees in Dushanbe.

In Qurghonteppa this resulted in competition between Gharmi Tajiks who backed the opposition and Kulobi Tajiks who backed the government and worked against the reforms. Rahmonov won a decisive victory in the presidential election of 1994, with opposition only from a second hard-line politician of similar background, in what was generally labeled a rigged outcome. In July 1993, Congress signed a trade agreement with Tajikistan. At first much of the violence lacked broader coordination as no well-organised armed forces with acknowledged leadership existed at the outbreak of the civil war. The opposition regarded him as no better than Nabyev or Iskandarov. Rahmon was indeed a part of efforts to reach peace in Tajikistan, but he was just one of many people involved in the process .

And at the end of September 1996, the Taliban captured Kabul and continued driving northward, to areas where the UTO had established bases and where tens of thousands of refugees from Tajikistan were sheltering. SRSG Meets Members of the International Community:  The same day, the SRSG met members of the international community, other UN agencies as well as international organisations and NGOs operating in Tajikistan, to inform them of the details of the tragedy and discuss security measures required in the event of MILOBs being recalled to Dushanbe. Parts of northeastern Tajikistan remain largely under the control of former UTO fighters who have rejected the terms of the peace settlement . Then, in a long procession of over fifty UN vehicles, more than four hundred people who had attended the ceremony accompanied the coffins to Dushanbe Airport from where the bodies were sent in a UN airplane to their countries of origin: Poland, Uruguay and Japan. The leadership of the IRP, despite their pretentions to being a party for all (Sunni) Muslims, was heavily staffed by Tajiks with roots in one particular region. In December Rahmonov signed a peace agreement with Sayed Abdullo Nuri, leader of the opposition Islamic Rebirth Party. Most of the last remaining holdouts in Pamir region laid down their weapons when the Aga Khan visited and September 1998 and encouraged the people of Gorno-Badakhshan to make peace with the government . Also attending were representatives of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (known as the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe until December 1994), and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. WATCH: Twenty Years Later: The Tajik Civil War And Its Aftermath  The first round of talks between the Tajik government and battlefield opponents the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) took place in Moscow in April 1994 after some shuttle diplomacy by Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamshin, who had been traveling between Dushanbe and Tehran, where the UTO leadership was based. First Phase of the Tajikistan Civil War in 1992  The Kulyabis launched a scorched earth offensive in the Garm and Kurgan-Tyube valleys. SRSG Hold a Press Conference and Condemns the Murders:  Immediately after his meeting with the President, the SRSG held a Press Conference in Dushanbe in which he referred to the ""tragedy"" as being in his opinion "" unprecedented"" in the annals of the United Nations. But if Russia had wanted to, then this war would have ended much earlier, but this did not happen. Opposition politicians were based in Iran. Russian air attacks on opposition villages in south-central Tajikistan contravened a three-month extension of the UN-sponsored cease-fire (originally signed in 1994). Refugees are fleeing the threat of military action following the September 11 attacks; forced conscription by the Taliban; politically motivated attacks by the Taliban against ethnic groups believed to be sympathetic to the opposition ; fighting between Taliban and United Front forces; as well as the growing humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan, exacerbated by the onset of winter. Led by the Popular Front of Tajikistan, the main pro- government army in the civil war, they conducted a campaign of summary executions and ""disappearances"" of people of Pamiri and Garmi (regions of Tajikistan that had supported the DPT-IRP coalition) origins, killing more than 300 and ""disappearing"" hundreds of others. The warring parties had a strong regional base. Kirill Nourzhanov and Christian Bleuer wrote: ""Early guesstimates (which went almost entirely unchallenged) for the conflict as a whole cited the number of deaths as high as 100 000; however, a later study put the number at 23 500, with 20 000 of these deaths occurring in 1992. The next day, at 11 o’clock in the morning, all the hostages were brought to the hall of the Supreme Council ... It turns out that the day before, when we crossed the police post, Nasriddinov, who was walking behind me, turned right and went past the Ministry of Culture to Lenina Street, and there he was pushed into a gas truck and taken to the headquarters of the opposition . The government of Emomali Rahmon has pursued a distinct ethno-centric approach to national consolidation since 1997, focusing on the historical exceptionalism of the Tajiks, their moderate Muslim sensibilities, and the 'othering' of Turkic neighbours. The five-year civil war that ended in 1997 led to the deaths of more than 150,000 people and saw over one-tenth of the Tajik population flee the country. t Contact Group Condemns the Brutal Murders  Members of the Contact Group met on July 23 and strongly condemned what they described as the organisers and perpetrators of this ruthless crime and asked the Government of Tajikistan and the UTO to make immediate efforts to identify the murderers. Peace negotiations were continually postponed. Russian air attacks on opposition villages in south-central Tajikistan contravened a three-month extension of the UN-sponsored cease-fire (originally signed in 1994). TAJIKISTAN CIVIL WAR In 1992 a short-lived coalition government broke down, sending the country into a civil war that was won nominally when the old guard forces captured Dushanbe and named Imomali Rahmonov chief executive. Last week the UTO sent a letter to Annan saying it would boycott the signing ceremony unless there was an exchange of war prisoners, and a clarification of the posts to be offered to the opposition in a future government. The movement's supporters were calling for the NRM to have seats at the peace negotiations . [Source: ""Tajikistan: Political and Social History"" by Kirill Nourzhanov and Christian Bleuer, Australia National University, 2013 ><]  ""The largest contribution to the opposition 's demonstrations was by the Islamic Revival Party (IRP). Again, as mentioned above, the blocs in the conflict were not monolithic and should be seen as the end result of not just long-term historical and cultural factors, but also more recent political and economic competition, as well as a result of the initial tactics and strategies of mobilising for political struggles and war. Pro -Communist Kulyabs rulers were installed in January 1993. Peace Talks in the Tajikistan Civil War in 1996  In April 1994, peace talks arranged by the United Nations (UN) began between the post-civil war government in Dushanbe and members of the exiled opposition. TAJIKISTAN Human Rights Developments Following the government's victory in the civil war against an alliance consisting of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan (DPT) and the Islamic Revival Party (IRP), Tajikistan became a human rights disaster area. But the war went on for another five years...  And then I suggested that all the opposing factions lay down their arms. Their presence was largely supported by the local population because they helped to end the war and kept violence from flaring up. Civil war broke out in May 1992 and by year's end conservative estimates put the death toll at more than 20,000. The so-called Islamic forces, or Muslim rebels, consisted of Muslim extremists, moderate Muslims, intellectuals, democrats and Tajik clans and warlords—primarily from Garm and Gorno-Badakhshan—that opposed the government. A peace accord signed by the UTO and the government in June 1997 provided for, among other things, UTO representatives to be appointed to 30 percent of all government posts. This would apply also to ethnicity in the case of Uzbeks and Pamiris, who came to be identified with the 'pro- government ' and opposition sides, respectively. This was followed by a period of government crackdowns and harassment of the opposition , resulting in large anti-government street demonstrations in the capital starting in early spring 1992. After some time the political foes settled into two opposing coalitions: the incumbent leadership dominated by elites from Leninobod along with their primary junior partners from Kulob and Hisor, and the opposition coalition that included new political parties such as the mostly urban Democratic Party of Tajikistan, the Gharmi Tajik-dominated Islamic Revival Party, and the Pamiri party La'li Badakhshon. As the conflict worsened, leaders of the militias emerged—very few of them familiar to those outside their home areas. Their presence was largely supported by the local population because they helped to end the war and kept violence from flaring up. In August 1996, opposition troops moved close to Dushanbe amid intensified fighting that ended yet another cease -fire agreement. ""As the demonstrations intensified and eventually turned to violence , political and social authorities who could not quickly mobilise manpower for violent conflict became powerless. Continuing Political Violence Assassinations of high-level political figures in 2001 reflected persistent internal power struggles among political leaders and regional groups, in a pattern persistent since the June 1997 peace accords. SRSG meets the family of Jorajon Mahramov  :  On the morning of Thursday 23 July the SRSG went to give his personal condolences to the family of Mr Jorajon Mahramov in their residence. Summing up the meeting, Abdullajonov said: ""The ability to resolve these issues will show who is who in the current leadership of the republic."" The Russians provided the Tajikistan government with heavy weaponry, manpower and money. Prime Minister Abdullajonov, who said: ""Today at 5 pm there will be a meeting of acting. They said that Aslonov would be handed over to the judicial authorities, the court should consider Aslonov's activities during his leadership and determine the degree of his guilt. The pro -Communist Tajikistan government was armed with tanks, armored personnel carriers and weapons and supplies brought in on Russian supply lines and logistical support. Language, ethnicity, sub-ethnic identity, religious sect, region of origin, collective farm affiliation, family ties, professional relationships, political party membership, employer-employee ties and government patron-client networks have all been cited as factors in determining individual and group participation or non-participation in the conflict . The opposition refused to participate. Although the new constitution approved in November 1994 contained substantial guarantees of human rights (also staples of all the Soviet-era constitutions), prescribed legislative and review functions for the legislature, and mandated an independent judiciary, in fact the country's governance amounted to one-man rule based on declarations of emergency executive powers extended from 1993 and 1994.

Aside from the deaths of combatants and numerous unarmed civilians, the conflict generated a massive number of refugees and internally displaced persons, led to large-scale destruction and looting of property, resulted in the rape and torture of many, and further harmed the already fragile economy while devastating the livelihoods of many in Tajikistan. Tajikistan: Opposition Warns It May Not Sign Peace Accord  Moscow, 23 June 1997 (RFE/RL) - The United Tajik Opposition has again warned that it may not sign a peace accord with the Tajik government , planned for later this month, unless certain demands are met.

In August 1996, opposition troops moved close to Dushanbe amid intensified fighting that ended yet another cease-fire agreement. At the end of his speech, he said that in order to stabilize the socio-political situation, to stop the fratricidal war , he decided to resign and asked to consider the issue of his pension provision and other benefits previously established for the President. The Tajik peace talks in Ashgabat would not conclude until July 1996, and in between January and July Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Russia Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov made separate trips to Ashgabat in an attempt to keep negotiations going. Civil War Breaks Out in Tajikistan in 1992  The civil war in Tajikistan broke out less than a year after independence when long-buried clan and political animosity erupted. In August 1996, opposition troops moved close to Dushanbe amid intensified fighting that ended yet another cease-fire agreement. The reason was an attempt by one of the parties to free fellow villagers taken hostage. In a message from Teheran, the UTO leader , Said Abdullo Nuri, condemned the killings and said that he had asked all field commanders to do all they could to help the investigations.

It is difficult to say anything definite about how the behind-the-scenes negotiations between the deputies representing the opposing sides of the conflict took place, in view of the fact that journalists were not invited to them. A dramatic example was the July 2001 arrest in Moscow of Dodojon Atovullo, exiled editor-in-chief of the independent opposition newspaper Charogi Ruz (Light of Day). There was fighting, violence and instability after the peace accord was signed . The Security Council President, Sergey Larov, of the Russian Federation said the Security Council members also called on the Government of Tajikistan to finalize their investigation ""as soon as possible"". This epilogue will provide a brief overview and short analysis of the most important phase of the civil war: from the outbreak of violence to the military victory of the anti-opposition Popular Front forces in December 1992 and the arrival in the capital of Tajikistan's new leader, Emomali Rahmon. Russian air attacks on opposition villages in south-central Tajikistan contravened a three-month extension of the UN-sponsored cease -fire (originally signed in 1994). By the time the government weakened and violent conflict started in May 1992, the only willing and able factions were the Gharmi Tajik-dominated IRP and their Pamiri allies in the security forces on one side and the Kulobi and Hisor-based actors on the other. The opposition refused to participate. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) said it will send a representative to Friday's signing ceremony in Moscow. There was fighting, violence and instability after the peace accord was signed . On June 21, the Supreme Court of Tajikistan banned the DPT, IRP, the popular movement Rastokhez, and La'li Badakhshan (a Pamiri organization) for having organized the mass demonstrations in 1992 and for allegedly organizing fighters during the civil war .

But conflict persisted, based partly on the geographical and clan divisions of the country and partly on the political question of reform versus reaction. By the end of the decade the Leninabadi old guard had been marginalised from government and the Kulobi faction retained power under President Emomali Rakhmonov. The most significant result was a cease -fire agreement that took effect in October 1994.

(186 votes for and 11 against) was elected chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic. Rakhmon Nabiev, the first elected president of Tajikistan, was a member of the old elite. Emomali Rahmon, who, as speaker of parliament had been head of state in Tajikistan since November 1992, was elected to the newly recreated post of president. The most acceptable options were:  - Preservation of the presidential post and his election directly at the session of the Supreme Council;  - transition to parliamentary government, while maintaining the powers of the current people's deputies, by electing a permanent parliament from this composition, to form a state council;  - to form a coalition government. But the most important thing is that the government was chosen legally. The government was not chosen by either Russia or Uzbekistan. Emomali Rakhmonov, after being elected chairman of the Supreme Council, actively joined in the leadership of the republic. At the suggestion of the conciliation commission, Khabibullo Tabarov, one of the oldest deputies, was elected chairman of the session by a majority of votes. Then the people's deputies proceeded to consider the issue of electing a new chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the republic. It is known that after his election as Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic, Emomali Rakhmonov addressed the people with the words: “Dear brothers and sisters, dear comrades-in-arms, I am writing to you at a difficult time for our country.

support," [Source: Library of Congress, March 1996 *]  The Popular Front — the pro-government, neo-Communists — was supported by the Kulyabi clan from the south and the clan from Khujand region in the north, which had good relations with the Soviet elite. They were believed to be armed and supported in part by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. When the power struggles in Dushanbe led to civil unrest and violent conflict, national-level elites and local powerbrokers mobilised support from the local level, drawing on and appealing to ties of identity, shared economic concerns and common security dilemmas. They reportedly enjoy the support of former UTO field commanders, with whom they fought as allies during the civil war. Some of these sites offer 24/7 support and have customer service representatives who are there to help you play slots online. In the campaign, apparently coordinated with Moscow, Tajikistani troops moved with Russian air support eastward into the country's narrow central corridor toward opposition strongholds. When the power struggles in Dushanbe led to civil unrest and violent conflict, national-level elites and local powerbrokers mobilised support from the local level, drawing on and appealing to ties of identity, shared economic concerns and common security dilemmas. The President called reports of military support by the Belarusian leadership of paramilitary formations in the Middle East regions a lie. They were believed to be armed and supported in part by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The unicameral legislature offers decisive majority support for Rahmonov's programs, and the judiciary is fully under the control of the president, who has the power to dismiss any judge. Instead of leading an effort to punish all parties guilty of crimes during and after the civil war, the government imprisoned during the year at least nineteen people who supported the DPT-IRP coalition. In the campaign, apparently coordinated with Moscow, Tajikistani troops moved with Russian air support eastward into the country's narrow central corridor toward opposition strongholds. Most of these parties identified themselves by ideology, (e.g., promoting 'democracy' or 'Islamic values' or a revitalised 'Tajik nation') but drew their support from a particular region. [Source: Library of Congress, March 1996 *]  The Popular Front — the pro-government, neo-Communists — was supported by the Kulyabi clan from the south and the clan from Khujand region in the north, which had good relations with the Soviet elite. Until 1998 the UTO enjoyed the support of the pre-Taliban government in Afghanistan, in particular President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his defense minister, the late Gen. The conflict was the culmination of a power struggle between a communist-led government that was dominated by people from Leninabad (known as ""Leninabadis""), and an opposition coalition that drew support primarily from people whose origins were from the northeast (""Gharmis"") and Gorno-Badakhshan (""Pamiris""). The conflict was the culmination of a power struggle between a communist-led government that was dominated by people from Leninabad (known as ""Leninabadis""), and an opposition coalition that drew support primarily from people whose origins were from the northeast (""Gharmis"") and Gorno-Badakhshan (""Pamiris""). Former UTO members occupy senior positions in the government, and the IRP enjoys parliamentary representation, but in practice these officials and parliamentary deputies support official policy and the president on almost all points. The government has arrested scores of members of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), an Islamic group that supports the reestablishment of the Caliphate, or Islamic state, for Muslims by peaceful means. The disappeared were principally individuals who supported the DPT-IRP coalition or who were of Pamiri or Garmi origins. The Islamic forces, was supported mainly by the Garmis (or Garms) from the remote southern province of Garm, the Pamiris (Badakhshans) from the Pamir region of Gorno-Badakhshan and clans from the Kurgan-Tyube valley. Since September 11, Russia has increased its material support for the United Front delivered via the Dushanbe airport. The unicameral legislature offers decisive majority support for Rahmonov's programs, and the judiciary is fully under the control of the president, who has the power to dismiss any judge. He said the UN had lost four of its members when ""they were performing their duties, their mandate, working with full responsibility, supporting peace and stability in this country"". The Islamic forces, was supported mainly by the Garmis (or Garms) from the remote southern province of Garm, the Pamiris (Badakhshans) from the Pamir region of Gorno-Badakhshan and clans from the Kurgan-Tyube valley. The government was supported in the civil war by people from Kuliab (""Kuliabis),"" a district in the southern Khatlon province. This issue was to be decided by the people's deputies themselves, so this proposal received the support of only 15 deputies during the voting. The pro-Communist Tajikistan government was armed with tanks, armored personnel carriers and weapons and supplies brought in on Russian supply lines and logistical support . Further, the 201st Motorized Rifle Division played a strategic role in the civil war by providing material support to the Kuliabi-based paramilitary groups. Most of these parties identified themselves by ideology, (e.g., promoting 'democracy' or 'Islamic values' or a revitalised 'Tajik nation') but drew their support from a particular region. Some of them supported the proposal to bring peacekeeping forces into the republic.

rape," By their accounts, the rapes took place in specific locations - a medical complex, a cemetery, and the grounds of Khartoum University's mosque. The four stripped and raped her, she said. A paramilitary unit he was in charge of, the Rapid Support Forces, with links to the notorious Janjaweed militia, was involved in the mass rape and butchery of civilians while battling rebels in Darfur. ""I didn't tell them I'd been raped , but I think they knew from my condition."" Other members of the Armed Forces committed, according to human rights groups, rape , torture and murder of civilians in the Sudanese region of Darfur. She does not know the names of the men who raped her, much less who is the father of her child. ""I was trying to scream, but they shut my mouth,"" Samah said, adding three of them raped her. It ""found a number of crimes, including rape , that were committed during the dispersal, and also identified some suspects"", he said, refusing to give details. ""We heard women screaming and crying,"" as they were raped , she said. 'Chills through my body' Rape victims told similar stories of RSF soldiers corralling men and women who fled the protest site, beating them, sexually molesting the women and gang-raping some. The troops shouted insults and threats of rape , said Sara Ali Abdulla, a doctor who managed to get out of the mosque compound. Both experts say the real number is considerably higher, since many victims do not speak out for fear of reprisal or the stigma connected to rape , and that many more women were sexually assaulted as well as several men. A military-backed prosecutor said no rapes or sexual assaults took place during the violence. For Samah, a 28-year-old teacher, the wounds of her gang- rape that day are reopened whenever she sees Dagalo on TV. Dozens of women raped by Sudanese security forces over the course of a few hours on June 3, 2019, are still seeking justice, a year after a brutal crackdown that left at least 87 people dead. Four of them raped her, biting her breasts so hard they bled, she said. She wakes up terrified at night, because she sees her rapists ' faces in her sleep.

rebellion," FRONASA  Initially, only the few trained soldiers among the rebel force participated in fighting and they were predominantly FRONASA fighters who trained in Monduli, Tanzania. Within four months, the rebels had been routed out of West Nile and many of them fled to Zaire (now DR Congo) or Sudan. The rebels say that Amin's former soldiers do not honor human rights, ""do not want democracy"" and should be punished for crimes committed during Amin's 1971-79 rule. 's role, the first man to be injured in the five-year war.Just as his military number, RO 0024 suggests, Chihandae is one of the founders of the National Resistance Army (NRA), but he later fell out of favour after the takeover of Kampala on January 26,1986.Veterans of the Luwero-bush war say Chihandae provided 16 of the 27 guns the NRA used to launch its rebellion in 1981. The rebels were however surrounded by the UNLA soldiers who had duped them that they had deserted the barracks and inflicted serious casualities.After this surprise attack, Chihandae's 9th battalion and Chefe Ali's 11th battalion were ordered to besiege Mbarara Barracks forcing it to surrender in late 1985. Those who misbehaved were caned 50 strokes each hence the name, 'Safari 50' as the aborted journey came to be called.The attack had been planned to be executed by three battalions; the 1st Battalion under Pecos Kutesa deputized by Edward Barihona, the 2nd Battalion under Chihandae, deputized by Ahmed Kashilingi and Joram Mugume's 3rd Battalion.Chihandae was also responsible for preventing the UNLA forces based in Bukomero from attacking the main rebel base. It is not surprising that when Rwigyema joined the NRA rebellion , Kagame followed suit. Although the alleged coup against Museveni had been planned to take place when he was away from the bush (between June -December 1981), the rebel leader got to know about it and was able to suppress it. This attack was so important, coming on the back of the UNLA's February 21, 1983 ambush of NRA mobile forces, that killed 10 fighters and injured Commander Salim Saleh during the battle of Bukalabi.Because Saleh had been injured, David Tinyefuza led the Rapid Response Force's onslaught on UNLA forces that had camped at Katiti sub-county headquarters, a few miles from the rebel base.So important was this operation that several senior officers were asked to take part. This was the rebel group of Maj. Soori, who served in the Pakistani military, said he fights not for Uganda, but out of personal loyalty to the force's leader , Lutaakome A. Kayiira, whom he met several years ago in New York. PAUL KAGAME's role  A Tanzanian-trained spy, Paul Kagame, now President of Rwanda - was the counter-intelligence chief of rebel NRA leader Yoweri Museveni. The government was now aware of the rebel activities and the guns from Libya would not arrive in time. With more arms, the rebels opened a second front, commonly known as the Western Axis with Rwigyema as the overall commander and Moses Kigongo as overall political head.Jim Muhwezi was the intelligence chief and Col. One of these rebels groups was the Holy Spirit Movement (HSM), which led by Alice Auma who claimed to speak to spirits. Kagame who trained in intelligence gathering in Tanzania in 1979 - went on to become rebel leader Yoweri Museveni's most trusted spy. Conspiracy appears to have crept into the NRA guerrilla movement at the very launch of the rebellion and this prompted the rebel leader to engage some fighters to spy on others. No one should be confused by this rebellion ."" Museveni also dispatched Kagame alongside other fighters to verify the authenticity of another rebel force that reportedly wanted to join the NRA. The stated aims of the incursions were to rescue abducted children and to capture or kill Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony and his key commanders. PAUL KAGAME's role  A Tanzanian-trained spy, Paul Kagame, now President of Rwanda - was the counter-intelligence chief of rebel NRA leader Yoweri Museveni. War against NRA in Luweero  Maj Gen Oyite-Ojok, who was commanding an operation against the NRA insurgents led by Yoweri Museveni, died in a helicopter crash in December 1983. After taking power, Museveni quickly stopped North Korean military training in the problematic northern regions and soon signed new military agreements with the leadership in Pyongyang. The success of this operation lifted the spirits of the rebels who had been beaten at Bukalabi and Katiti and were being pursued by the UNLA.When NRA resolved to attack Masindi barracks around 1984, Chihandae's second battalion was supposed to be the point unit but it was hit by the UNLA and again an operation under Tumwine was called off. Conspiracy appears to have crept into the NRA guerrilla movement at the very launch of the rebellion and this prompted the rebel leader to engage some fighters to spy on others. These leaders were used to sensitize the local communities, create good working relationships between the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) and the local people, and to create a friendly atmosphere between the people of Teso, Lango, Acholi, Bugishu and Kapchorwa. It is claimed that Magara wanted to break the NRA force and lead some fighters to another rebel force based in the Rwenzori Mountain. I do not know who was to lead but that attack was more important to Rugumayo's group than to Museveni."" On August 25, 1996, Karimojong leaders traveled through Lodwar to Lokiriama in Turkanaland where a number of animals were handed over to them. Conspiracy appears to have crept into the NRA guerrilla movement at the very launch of the rebellion and this prompted the rebel leader to engage some fighters to spy on others. Kagame who trained in intelligence gathering in Tanzania in 1979 - went on to become rebel leader Yoweri Museveni's most trusted spy. 's role, the first man to be injured in the five-year war.Just as his military number, RO 0024 suggests, Chihandae is one of the founders of the National Resistance Army (NRA), but he later fell out of favour after the takeover of Kampala on January 26,1986.Veterans of the Luwero-bush war say Chihandae provided 16 of the 27 guns the NRA used to launch its rebellion in 1981. AN INSURGENCY BEGINS  After rebel groups developed in the northern regions, Museveni struggled to consolidate his power in the late 1980s. We are told that when rebel Alice Lakwena hit the new NRA government and marched towards Magamaga, some ministers panicked and wanted to flee. Specialising in counter intelligence, Kagame spied on colleagues to establish mainly who was undermining the struggle from within or undermining the authority of the rebel leader. Although the alleged coup against Museveni had been planned to take place when he was away from the bush (between June -December 1981), the rebel leader got to know about it and was able to suppress it. It is after the media published a story of a bush-war hero who was vending charcoal that Museveni appointed him minister councilor at Cairo embassy.Veterans wonder why the man who provided 16 of the 27 guns they used to launch the rebellion was not even appointed on the historical high command. This is the day when the Popular Resistance Army (PRA), led by Yoweri Museveni, then a guerrilla leader , attacked Kabamba Military Barracks in Mubende District. Even when David Tinyefuza, currently the Coordinator of Intelligence, became the overall Director of Military Intelligence of the rebel force, Kagame still operated independently and continued to report directly to CHC. During one of the battles, Amin's former minister of Education, Brig Kili, who had become a rebel commander, was captured by Ogole who ensured his safety. Only 33 people, including Kagame, who attended the meeting at Mathew Rukikaire's residence on February 3 that planned the first attack, knew about this weapon that would help the rebels gain access to the armoury and get more guns. In Nairobi he reunited with Sam Katabarwa, the man who persuaded him to join the rebellion .A senior UPDF officer told The Observer that Dr.",A0_pag_rebel,Tanzania,A1_ppt_against_whom/what,Museveni,A2_vsp_domain_in_which_rebellion_occurs,Tanzania

Although the rebels went ahead with the planned attack, their mission to break open the underground armoury failed.

The second betrayal was that Lule was waiting for Museveni to join him after the 1980 elections, but instead he joined another group and attacked Kabamba."" This operation almost turned into a disaster with its overall commander, David Tinyefuza, severely injured by the UNLA fire. Following the withdrawal of the government's limited ceasefire offer in April 2003 and the dismissal of PPT Chair Eriya Kategaya, another new peace team (Uduru Kuc) was established, but again to little effect. But the ceasefire enabled the UPDF to redeploy back to Karamoja and revive its brutal, military-led disarmament process, which required a new humanitarian response. The senior officers included; Jim Muhwezi, Ahmed Kashilingi and Steven Kashaka and it came almost two days after the Bukalabi incident.Chihandae was Tinyefuza's second in command during this operation . The soldier had fired his anti tank grenade in the air and fled upon realizing that his barracks had been attacked by the rebels. The drought that followed that year killed about 50,000 people out of the 360,000 who dwell in these highlands. Ogole soon embarked on the mission, reorganised the army, commanded about 6,000 soldiers and attacked the NRA strongholds, which forced the insurgents to retreat towards western Uganda. After failing to get guns from Kabamba, the rebels attacked some police posts but Kakiri was the next major operation . He also took part in the April 4, 1981 attack on Kakiri Barracks—probably the second major operation of the new rebel group. The memoir says Ogole he attacked and disorganised NRA bases in Luweero and inflicted heavy casualties, forcing them to retreat to Rwenzori region and western DR Congo. Turning down Museveni's appeal to assemble in safe-zones, the LRA demanded that a ceasefire be extended throughout the whole region. The government-UNRF II ceasefire that occurred in June 2002 was presented by the Ugandan Government as a by-product of Operation Iron Fist. ""As they were waiting, this one (Museveni) come with very few people, about 35 and one lorry, and they attacked Kabamba. He is also said to have participated in mobilising the early recruits from places such as Kitgum, Lira and Moroto.His role during the attack on Kabamba was to destroy the communication room (signal centre) in the barracks. The cessation of hostilities that followed in September was a blessing to the LRA-affected populations of northern Uganda. On 15 November 2004 the government declared a seven-day ceasefire to enable Betty Bigombe, a former minister, to pursue talks with support from the US, the UK and the Netherlands. ""By attacking Kabamba, Museveni caused insecurity and the UNLA placed roadblocks everywhere. They wanted to know why Museveni had attacked Kabamba. Turning down Museveni's appeal to assemble in safe-zones, the LRA demanded that a ceasefire be extended throughout the whole region. The government-UNRF II ceasefire that occurred in June 2002 was presented by the Ugandan Government as a by-product of Operation Iron Fist. This was extended for a longer period but hostilities soon resumed when the LRA attacked Alero, Gulu district, on 1 January 2005. It is claimed that neither Rwigyema nor Kagame participated directly in the planning of the bush war but they both turned up at the final meeting at Mathew Rukikaire's home before the group set off to attack Kabamba. Only 33 people, including Kagame, who attended the meeting at Mathew Rukikaire's residence on February 3 that planned the first attack , knew about this weapon that would help the rebels gain access to the armoury and get more guns. Frederick Guweddeko, a researcher and PhD fellow at Makerere Institute of Social Research (MISR), reveals another side to the attack on Kabamba Military Barracks. The betrayal  At the time of the Kabamba attack , Lule and Kayiira were still waiting for arms from Libya. Fred Rwigyema when an NRA force attacked Kiboga in June 1983. According to Pecos Kutesa, Museveni even filmed the operation and took some photographs. When he started his operation , the NRA had their tactical headquarters just at the outskirt of Kampala at a place called Kawanda and were ready to pounce on the government and overthrow it any time. Commander Mutebi died during the operation and Chihandae took over.Chihandae also participated in the attack of UNLA soldiers who had camped at Katiti sub-county headquarters that took place in February 1983. The success of this operation lifted the spirits of the rebels who had been beaten at Bukalabi and Katiti and were being pursued by the UNLA.When NRA resolved to attack Masindi barracks around 1984, Chihandae's second battalion was supposed to be the point unit but it was hit by the UNLA and again an operation under Tumwine was called off. The attack on Kabamba  When Museveni decided to attack Kabamba Barracks, he collaborated with the Gang of Four. Ethnic tensions were aggravated in Lira and Gulu districts in early 2004 after the massacre of approximately 200 people at Barlonyo IDP camp in Lango sub-region prompted retaliatory attacks by Langi against Acholi, believing as many did that the massacre had been perpetrated by the 'Acholi' LRA. Although originally intended to expire within a matter of weeks, it was extended on numerous occasions. The operation 's impact, however, was in key respects the opposite of its stated goals: rather than rescuing abducted children and eliminating the LRA threat, it prompted an increase in both. Hazardous boat trip In 1985, after the Kabamba operation , I accompanied the CHC (Y.K. However, that night the university was heavily attacked by soldiers, commanded by Taban Amin, Idi Amin's son, who had recently enrolled to study English at the university though he had not had any other significant formal education. It was Chihandae who captured Kamwenge and Bihanga Prisons and later addressed a rally in Ibanda.Eventually the 9th, 11th and 15th battalions simultaneously attacked and overrun Mbarara Barracks. This was extended for a longer period but hostilities soon resumed when the LRA attacked Alero, Gulu district, on 1 January 2005. The government-UNRF II ceasefire that occurred in June 2002 was presented by the Ugandan Government as a by-product of Operation Iron Fist. This is the day when the Popular Resistance Army (PRA), led by Yoweri Museveni, then a guerrilla leader, attacked Kabamba Military Barracks in Mubende District. For example he deputized late Mutebi when the rebels carried out the Kakinga operation . The success of this operation lifted the spirits of the rebels who had been beaten at Bukalabi and Katiti and were being pursued by the UNLA.When NRA resolved to attack Masindi barracks around 1984, Chihandae's second battalion was supposed to be the point unit but it was hit by the UNLA and again an operation under Tumwine was called off. ""Kayiira's army was waiting for Museveni's Kikosi Vita so when he made his attacks , these fighters would not fight for the UNLA, but would instead join him."" Kashilingi had then fallen out of favour with the powers that be (see The Observer, June 18-21, 2009).Both men were among the 10 commanding officers who headed the NRA's 10 battalions that launched a final assault on Kampala.Chihandae was one of the 33 men led by Yoweri Museveni who attacked Kabamba Barracks on February 6, 1981 in what marked the launch of the NRA bush-war. This attack was so important, coming on the back of the UNLA's February 21, 1983 ambush of NRA mobile forces, that killed 10 fighters and injured Commander Salim Saleh during the battle of Bukalabi.Because Saleh had been injured, David Tinyefuza led the Rapid Response Force's onslaught on UNLA forces that had camped at Katiti sub-county headquarters, a few miles from the rebel base.So important was this operation that several senior officers were asked to take part. The cessation of hostilities that followed in September was a blessing to the LRA-affected populations of northern Uganda. Guweddeko says if Museveni had not attacked Kabamba, the war would have been shorter.

Dealing with Conflicts in Karamoja: Non-Military Options  The NRA came to power in 1986 and to re-establish the authority of the state in Karamoja region, control cattle rustling, and consolidate the security in the region, it was left with one option -- a military one. Without their cooperation, the northern gun trade would be difficult to control . That struggle now appears to have reached a stalemate, with southern rebels having taken the southwestern third of the country from the northern- controlled national government. Because of these different state policies, the entire land area of Karamoja became either a Forest Reserve, Game Reserve, Controlled Hunting Area, National Park, buffer zone, or a military region. But both this militia and the ones subsequently established in the Lango sub-region (Rhino Boys) and Kitgum district (Frontier Guards) were rapidly brought under government control . Controlling Gun Trafficking in the Region  Among other reasons, the Vigilante Program in Karamoja was designed to register illegal guns in Karamoja.

Amin, whose government was accused of killing about 300,000 Ugandans over an eight-year period, is living in exile in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. Lumago said the structure of the army that went into exile after Amin's overthrow remains intact in southern Sudan and eastern Zaire and should be included in the talks. Issac Lumago, who once was Amin's chief of staff, repeatedly referred to the ex-dictator as ""field marshal"" and indicated that he should be allowed to return under a sweeping amnesty for Ugandan exiles . They were the Gang of Four, whose political leadership was in exile . He said he was not aware of any atrocities when he served Amin, and he called on the new government to welcome home all the East African nation's exiles , presumably including Amin. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Ugandan exile leader Yusufu Lule announced the formation of a new Ugandan government in which he will be president.

Dealing with Conflicts in Karamoja: Non-Military Options  The NRA came to power in 1986 and to re-establish the authority of the state in Karamoja region, control cattle rustling, and consolidate the security in the region, it was left with one option -- a military one. The capture of the capital came during the night, with unexpected suddenness and apparently relatively little bloodshed. After the capture of power, he was appointed deputy director of Military Intelligence in charge of counter intelligence. Capturing Kampala  Kagame remained an intelligence officer during and after the fall of Kampala to the NRA. ""We literally stole the capital,"" said one jubilant Tanzanian officer."" It was the first time in post-colonial Africa that troops of one black African state captured the capital of another, but Tanzania moved quickly to put the occupied portion of the country under control of a government headed by Ugandan exiles. Aftermath After the capture of state power in 1986, I served as Minister of State in the Office of The President, Minister of State for Internal Affairs, National Political Commissar, Member of the Army Council, Member of the High Command, Member of the NRC (the Parliament) and the Constituent Assembly. Tanzanian troops captured Kampala today, to the apparent delight of rejoicing Ugandans, and within hours a provisional civilian government was announced to replace dictator Idi Amin's battered regime. It was the first time in post-colonial Africa that troops of one black African state captured the capital of another, but Tanzania moved quickly to put the occupied portion of the country under control of a government headed by Ugandan exiles. When he returned home, he found his residence on Acacia Road in Kololo looted by soldiers who had been sent to look for guns he allegedly stashed away with the intention of shooting down Museveni's helicopter.Even after his release, the army closely watched his movements. The senior officers included; Jim Muhwezi, Ahmed Kashilingi and Steven Kashaka and it came almost two days after the Bukalabi incident.Chihandae was Tinyefuza's second in command during this operation. Issac Lumago came home to Uganda after the most recent coup. His posting to Cairo came as part of a rehabilitation drive after he spent about a year in a dungeon in Lubiri Barracks for allegedly aiding his friend, Col. Ahmed Kashilingi in November 1989.It is alleged that Elly Tumwine, the first NRA army commander after capturing power, did not like Chihandae to the extent that he would not return his salute. Chihandae who hails from Mbarara began his military career in 1979—the year he joined Yoweri Museveni's FRONASA, one of the groups that fought late President Idi Amin's regime.FRONASA guided the Tanzanian People's Defence Forces (TPDF) on the western axis whose main task was to capture Mbarara where Amin had a big barracks. ""I came back to the UFM here because UFM had some principles, freedom, democracy and all that bull----.""

These talks sought to end more than two decades of conflict between the government and the UNRF that had begun in 1979 following the ousting of Idi Amin Dada. A four-day, 750-mile journey through Karamoja Province, accompanying Melissa Wells of the United Nations Development Program, leaves a stark image of death and despair among the people here. This scheme, which effectively started in 1995, had a registered force of 8,000 vigilantes before the end of 1996. At least 10 Amin soldiers were beaten to death by Uganda civilians taking revenge on the dictator's men. After the tragic end of Oyite-Ojok, Obote appointed Lt Col Ogole to start from where Oyite-Ojok ended . Following the tragic death of Maj Gen David Oyite-Ojok in December 1983, it was clear that his most suitable replacement would be Lt Col John Ogole. They died when their car was hit by a rocket near the golf course. War against NRA in Luweero  Maj Gen Oyite-Ojok, who was commanding an operation against the NRA insurgents led by Yoweri Museveni, died in a helicopter crash in December 1983.

But the mood in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, changed to one of aggressive retribution last year after the death of Maj. Apparently, Oyite-Ojok had assured president Obote that by the end of December the rebels would be defeated. At least 10 Amin soldiers were beaten to death by Uganda civilians taking revenge on the dictator's men. Amid the stench of death , the Rev. This started in February 1977 when a law degree finalist called Sserwanga was shot dead outside University Hall by soldiers of the Uganda Army. This started in February 1977 when a law degree finalist called Sserwanga was shot dead outside University Hall by soldiers of the Uganda Army. ""The political situation at the beginning of 1981 was one of anticipated war,"" Guweddeko says, adding, ""There were three armed groups just waiting for the elections to end . It was under pressure to demonstrate its commitment to furthering regional peacemaking and to protecting its own citizens, while new economic opportunities created by a more stable southern Sudan added additional incentives to end the conflict. Muchunguzi was allegedly killed in order to quash a plot to oust Museveni which had been hatched by Sam Magara. Tough interrogation  High ranking bush-war generals remember how Kagame tortured a fellow NRA fighter, Jack Muchunguzi, to extract a confession following the murder of another colleague, Hannington Mugabi. Kutesa remembers that Kagame shot and killed a UNLA soldier called Mapengo. When at the end of 1978 the Tanzanian government decided to fight the Idi Amin regime, I, like so many other young people, were recruits-in-waiting. Kizza Besigye, the only officer who witnessed the killing , wondered in a past media interview why he was never asked to give evidence. Ugandans in the north of Uganda would not soon forget their Korean comrades  Alice Auma, also known as Alice Lakwena, speaks to journalists before her death in 2007  However, the HSM's tactics on the battlefield were bizarre. After the tragic end of Oyite-Ojok, Obote appointed Lt Col Ogole to start from where Oyite-Ojok ended.

""The political ceremony to admit Cambodia requires all (ASEAN) foreign ministers to sign...so until you get a consensus that's not going to happen,"" one senior ASEAN official said. EST (1839 GMT)  HANOI, Vietnam (CNN) -- The issue of Cambodia's admission into Southeast Asia's political organization sparked a diplomatic dispute on Tuesday. ASEAN nations disagree on admitting Cambodia  December 15, 1998  Web posted at: 1:39 p.m. ""When they have implemented their coalition agreements they will be admitted ."" Noun Chivorn, Charge d Affaires of the Royal Embassy of Cambodia  Distinguished Guests,  Ladies and Gentlemen,    A few moments ago, the ceremony for the admission of the Kingdom of Cambodia into ASEAN was held in Hanoi. But the apparent agreement disintegrated the following day when diplomats offered conflicting views on when Cambodia could join -- or if it already had. The meeting accomplished little, however, with Hun Sen demanding that ASEAN either admit 'his' country by 23 July or 'forget it for the next five or 20 years'. Yet Shanmugam Jayakumar, his Singaporean counterpart, said Phnom Penh would only join after fully carrying out constitutional reforms. ""We have decided (Cambodia's admission ) will take place in Hanoi, but we have not decided on a date,"" Jayakumar said. The association will likely delay the admission until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in late January, he said. It was also announced that Cambodia's admission into ASEAN would be delayed 'until a later date' and that Prince Ranariddh would continue to be recognised as the 'first' Prime Minister of Cambodia. Former invitation withdrawn  ASEAN had agreed in 1995 to admit Cambodia, along with Laos and Myanmar, at a ceremony two years later. Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar and Japan had lobbied for Cambodia's immediate ASEAN entry at the Hanoi summit. ASEAN leaders issued a vague statement Monday saying Cambodia would join , but no definite date was given.",A0_pag_accessor,capital,A1_ppt_thing_accessed,capital
withdrawal," Third, the de facto withdrawal of the Khmer Rouge from the peace process weakened UNTAC's ability to take action against the CPP. In August 1988, by which time Vietnam had withdrawn half its troops and most of its officials from Cambodia, and with the PRK resisting Vietnamese suggestions that it make a peace deal with the Khmer Rouge as well as other Cambodian adversaries, Hun Sen issued a Proclamation making himself, as chairman of the Council of Ministers, ""in charge directly … of the leadership of military and security work,"" while reducing the Minister of Defense to the person in charge only of the construction of military fortifications. Beginning in January 1992, the Khmer Rouge thus grew increasingly sceptical of the peace process: it renounced the ceasefire, refused to disarm, ended cooperation with UNTAC, boycotted the elections and eventually launched an unsuccessful military campaign to derail the elections. Former invitation withdrawn ASEAN had agreed in 1995 to admit Cambodia, along with Laos and Myanmar, at a ceremony two years later.

control," But the Khmer Rouge's actions - which it justified by UNTAC's alleged refusal to implement the agreements' provisions on verifying withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and controlling the SoC structure - ironically served to make implementation harder and the CPP stronger. This kept the armed forces out of the control of former East Zone CPK military cadre, such as Heng Samrin and Pol Saroeun. Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP  Making of a strongman: In July 1997, Hun Sen took full control of the country - and his party  Over two days of bloody armed battles 20 years ago today, forces loyal to Hun Sen routed troops supporting Prince Norodom Ranariddh, marking the moment Hun Sen crowned himself Cambodia's supreme leader and decisively quashed any opposition to himself or his party from their royalist rivals. With the Khmer Rouge out, UNTAC needed the remaining factions in order for there to be a peace process at all, in particular the CPP which controlled almost all of the territory on which UNTAC was deployed. [21] The Supreme Political Commissariat was responsible for ensuring the loyalty of the armed forces to the ruling party, the goal being to achieve 100 percent political control of the army from top to bottom. As for UNTAC attempts to oversee CPAF, the CPP correctly assessed that this would fail in the face of its ""one-party system"" of bureaucracy "" controlling the social structure from top to bottom,"" which was ""so integrated that UNTAC simply could not penetrate it"" and ""could easily withstand anything."" The GRK commander had direct control over a headquarters ""country surface"" force regularly deployed in contingents around the country, headquarters mobile intervention forces available for deployment anywhere, and a headquarters military police unit operating nationally in cases where the target of those operations was military personnel. The Paris Agreements' mandate for UNTAC to exert direct control over specified functions of SOC, the opposition FUNCINPEC, and other former insurgent administrations in Cambodia included ""public security."" Further Control by the CPP Over the Armed Forces  Though Hun Sen signed the Paris Agreements on behalf of the CPP and committed to ending party control over the armed forces and other state institutions, the CPP has never relinquished control over the military (or police, judicial, or other state officials). Further Control by the CPP Over the Armed Forces  Though Hun Sen signed the Paris Agreements on behalf of the CPP and committed to ending party control over the armed forces and other state institutions, the CPP has never relinquished control over the military (or police, judicial, or other state officials). The Khmer Rouge hoped that a strong UNTAC and SNC would significantly weaken the SoC's control over the country. Subsequent events over 1992 and 1993 - particularly UNTAC's failure to control the SoC structure and the creation of a CPP-FUNCINPEC coalition government after the elections - only confirmed Pol Pot in his analysis. Chea Sim and Sar Kheng lost considerable power within the CPP, including any residual control of the police. Further Control by the CPP Over the Armed Forces  Though Hun Sen signed the Paris Agreements on behalf of the CPP and committed to ending party control over the armed forces and other state institutions, the CPP has never relinquished control over the military (or police, judicial, or other state officials). A UN survey mission that visited Phnom Penh in November-December 1991 interpreted this as including direct UNTAC control over the SOC Ministry of Interior. The continued Khmer Rouge attacks also made it easier - politically and practically - for the CPP to use violence against the 'opposition' parties as they sought to organise within SoC- controlled areas. Yet since the CPP had controlled the state apparatus for more than a decade, FUNCINPEC struggled to assert any power. According to a 2006 decision, although Sar Kheng formally led and managed ""all activities"" of the ministry, he did not have ""direct control "" over the police and, specifically, the ministry's central security component. Hun Sen and the CPP threatened secession of seven eastern provinces and renewed civil war if they were not made equal partners in a new government, including maintaining de facto control over the military and police.

The speed of the collapse of even the patina of democracy and basic rights has been startling. The PRK was opposed by the Khmer Rouge, which reformed and fought an almost continuous guerrilla war against the Cambodian government from 1979 to 1998, the year Pol Pot died amidst the collapse of the Khmer Rouge movement. Despite the strong human rights provisions in the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements and the 1993 constitution—and billions of dollars in development aid, including a plethora of technical assistance devoted to the rule of lanetw, judicial reform, and human rights—the country is rapidly reverting towards a one-party state.",A0_pag_causer_of_disintegration,speed,A1_ppt_thing_disintegating,human rights provisions

A former CPK East Zone Khmer Rouge cadre, Chea Sim was implicated in serious crimes there before crossing into Vietnam in 1978 and becoming involved in opposition to Pol Pot's leadership of the CPK. Hun Sen's forces have killed up to 40 members of the political opposition in custody, ''that changes things,'' though they said it was too early to say how. Minister of National Defense Tea Banh echoed Hun Sen's order to the security force commanders in a follow-up speech on July 28, 2015, adding that the opposition 's purported plotting of color revolution in the past had made him ""very angry"" and that it was now necessary to ""control democracy"" in Cambodia to prevent ""anarchy."" Pol Saroeun, among other senior officers, that ""the opposition "" was responsible for efforts to create instability. I remember what happened in 1997,"" Chhoun, a middle-aged tuk-tuk driver, told me at a rally for the main opposition party last month. As David Chandler notes of the political opposition at the time in his A History of Cambodia, ""The royalist party soon lost its voice in decision making as well as its freedom of manoeuvre."" These facts might explain the serial courses of action that Hun Sen has taken to neuter any effective political challenge from his opponents, most particularly the dissolution of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party. Cambodian People's Armed Forces, State of Cambodia, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia  In preparation for further Vietnamese troop withdrawals and a possible peace agreement, including the Khmer Rouge and other opposition forces, in April 1989chief of state Heng Samrin promulgated a new constitution transforming the PRK into the State of Cambodia (SOC). The fact that 2.9 million voters opted for the opposition CNRP - to the CPP's 3.2 million votes - at the 2013 general election indicated that a swathe of the public could imagine (even desire) a state not dominated by the ruling party. Over the past year alone the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has been dissolved and the official leader of the party, Kem Sokha, jailed on spurious treason charges. In practice, this meant the police aimed to eliminate three kinds of opposition : armed insurgency, organized but non-violent oppositional groups, and individual peaceful dissent. However, like the police and army at these levels, local gendarmes answered concurrently to municipal, provincial and district unified command committees chaired by governors of these territorial administrations empowered to suppress everything from armed opposition movements to ordinary criminal activities deemed to threaten public order. Pol Saroeun, who arrived in Vietnam in 1978, was also a significant player in the Vietnamese-backed opposition at that time. ""It's important to note that throughout all this infighting, the CPP remained united in its wider desire to crush the opposition , while key rivals continued to be linked by strong personal, family, and patronage links,"" said political analyst Strangio, author of Hun Sen's Cambodia. In fact, Hun Sen's proposal, according to Adams, ""was reportedly opposed by most CPP leaders, including Ke Kim Yan, Chea Sim and Sar Kheng. If anybody does not support the CPP, submit applications of resignation, and I can help you [with that] … But if you are loyal to the CPP you must vote for the CPP, and then you can stay Minister of Social Affairs Vong Sauth  Consider, for instance, Dith Munty, the Supreme Court chief justice who forcibly dissolved the opposition CNRP. When CPK Secretary Pol Pot launched a general and murderous purge of the East Zone in May 1978, Pol Saroeun escaped into the jungle, where he tried to organize armed opposition to the purge and massacres of the East Zone population by forces answering to Pol Pot. Cambodia's urban and younger voters, increasing as a percentage of the population, have strongly supported the opposition . The PRK was opposed by the Khmer Rouge, which reformed and fought an almost continuous guerrilla war against the Cambodian government from 1979 to 1998, the year Pol Pot died amidst the collapse of the Khmer Rouge movement. Pol Saroeun and other RCAF commanders also told them that the political opposition to Hun Sen was comprised of ""dishonest and unprincipled persons"" who ""are always making things up, distorting them, and using demagoguery with the evil intent of toppling the Royal Government."" At a ceremony on February 2, 2017, the defense minister followed up with an appeal to all armed forces personnel ""not to believe in incitement by the opposition party."" This government immediately unraveled under domestic and primarily international opposition , but Sihanouk remained Uppermost High Commander of a multi-partite Cambodian Armed Forces proclaimed on June 10. Hun Sen crossed into Vietnam in 1977 and became a key figure in the Vietnamese-sponsored organization in 1978 of armed and other opposition to Pol Pot's government, serving as the PRK's foreign minister, the world's youngest. The coup removed Ranariddh as First Prime Minister, killed many senior FUNCINPEC officers, drove Nhek Bunchhay and other surviving FUNCINPEC military leaders into more than a year of guerrilla opposition , and drove many FUNCINPEC and other political challengers to the CPP into temporary exile. Capable of using ""infantry weapons,"" including sniper rifles, it was assigned to participate together with the army in ""fending off evil situations"" that might be created by ""unfriends"" of the government and others ""of an opposition tendency"" whenever the ordinary police were unable to handle such situations. Similarly, there was never any sign at that stage that Moscow and Beijing had any interest in becoming directly involved in opposing the CPP's actions. Whether the broader CPP leadership and generals like Kim Yan opposed Hun Sen's battle plans remains up for debate, but it is widely believed that they did, said Sophal Ear, an associate professor of world affairs and diplomacy at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Abuses since UNTAC (1993-Present)  After the departure of UNTAC in 1993, CPP political violence flared again, including against media critics and the new opposition Khmer Nation Party led by former FUNCINPEC finance minister Sam Rainsy, who was the target of a number of assassination attempts. Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP  Making of a strongman: In July 1997, Hun Sen took full control of the country - and his party  Over two days of bloody armed battles 20 years ago today, forces loyal to Hun Sen routed troops supporting Prince Norodom Ranariddh, marking the moment Hun Sen crowned himself Cambodia's supreme leader and decisively quashed any opposition to himself or his party from their royalist rivals. ""After, he had eliminated Funcinpec as a meaningful source of opposition and stamped his control on both the party and security forces, which henceforth became adjuncts to his barnstorming, personalized style of rule."" UNTAC-era Abuses  In October 1991, SOC, FUNCINPEC, a second non-communist opposition group (the Khmer People's National Liberation Front), and Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge signed the Paris ""Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict,"" which was also signed by 18 foreign governments. CPP-friendly media reported that what Hun Sen meant by a ""color revolution"" was a purported plot by the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) to incite mass protests to overthrow him. Instructions to the armed forces to act against the opposition were repeated, at times in even more threatening tones, in 2016, especially after small civil society-led peaceful protests in May against the politically motivated arrest and charging of five human rights defenders in connection with activities aimed at opposing human rights violations. And in July, when Ranariddh was accused of moving forces out of Anlong Veng with plans to launch his own coup, he did not need the support of the rest of the party - even if Chea Sim, Sar Kheng, Ke Kim Yan and Defence Minister Tea Banh still opposed a battle. But opposition and royal officials said Sunday the country should put the past behind it and unite to solve its modern challenges. But he said he joined the Rescue Party ceremony ""to pay respect to the souls [of dead soldiers]."" Hun Sen has responded by suggesting that engaging in opposition politics or criticizing him, the CPP or the government is a form of treason. Et Sarat, responsible for military training, ordered RCAF officers to ensure that the armed forces ""absolutely oppose "" all activities deemed to ""intend to destroy the security, good order, and stability of society."" Ke Kimyan, who opposed and did not participate in the 1997 coup, was said to lack power to give orders to Pol Saroeun, who had given orders to key military forces participating in the coup. It was also opposed by various non-communist anti-PRK movements, most notably the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), founded in 1981 by Cambodia's former King Norodom Sihanouk and later led by his son, Norodom Ranariddh. The RPAFK was born out of guerrilla forces opposing Khmer Rouge rule. In these capacities, Pol Saroeun oversaw the creation and operation of a provincial security apparatus, including detention facilities where people accused of opposition to the PRK and the Vietnamese occupation were held indefinitely without charge or trial. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party held a ceremony at its headquarters in Phnom Penh on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the 1997 coup, in which the CPP defeated the royalist Funcinpec, dismantling a power-sharing agreement, installing Hun Sen as the sole prime minister, and leaving many senior royal officials dead.",A0_pag_complainer,capital,A1_ppt_thing_objected_to,capital

Aggressive attempts by the security forces to deter and suppress such gatherings sometimes precipitated social unrest, to which the security forces responded with excessive violence, including unnecessary lethal force resulting in the deaths of at least seven people in early 2014. The Gendarmerie was given the power to conduct judicial and administrative policing nationwide to suppress crime and maintain public order, doing so with regard both to military personnel and civilians, and thus to arrest both and turn them over to the custody of the courts for investigation and trial. Tea Banh praised the security forces for having prevented these activities by timely suppression of demonstrations and protests. However, like the police and army at these levels, local gendarmes answered concurrently to municipal, provincial and district unified command committees chaired by governors of these territorial administrations empowered to suppress everything from armed opposition movements to ordinary criminal activities deemed to threaten public order. They were tasked to suppress all opponents of the PRK and the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia, Khmer Rouge or otherwise, including ""undercover enemies"" within the ranks of the PRK itself. As co-minister, Hun Sen made ""public security"" his priority, stressing the role of police down to the commune level in ensuring suppression of what he called ""the extremists, the opportunists, and the imposters"" whom he alleged were disturbing it. However, the Ministry of Interior retained command over previously established specialized police forces with a national remit, including those responsible for suppressing anti-SOC activities. The violent suppression of your political opponents will in no way restore the stability and legitimacy of government in Cambodia.

speech," With Hun Sen presiding, 1,860 party delegates attended the conference, including 495 Central Committee members. Tea Banh explained to a RCAF Day gathering attended by Supreme Commander Gen. Gendarmerie chief Sao Sokha was one of several RCAF deputy supreme commanders attending Chea Dara's presentation . Honorary CPP Chairperson Heng Samrin vowed in his speech that ""no evil power"" would be allowed to ""hinder"" the CPP's development of Cambodia. ""And I have forces to do it, don't forget,"" Hun Sen said in the speech , according to the diplomat. On July 29, Chea Dara, an RCAF deputy supreme commander, explained to a meeting of military and police officers that this means they must defend the CPP against the CNRP and maintain Hun Sen in power because ""the army belongs to the CPP,"" and Hun Sen was the person ""rearing, nurturing, leading, and commanding"" it. In Hanoi for an official visit and to attend the conference, Hun Sen said late on Monday the ASEAN leaders' decision had been a victory for the new Cambodian government. As Minister of Social Affairs Vong Sauth was making a keynote speech to new civil servants in Phnom Penh in August 2017, he publicly confirmed this, as he engaged in a trait that dogs most ruling party officials: blatant honesty. Minister of National Defense Tea Banh echoed Hun Sen's order to the security force commanders in a follow-up speech on July 28, 2015, adding that the opposition's purported plotting of color revolution in the past had made him ""very angry"" and that it was now necessary to ""control democracy"" in Cambodia to prevent ""anarchy."" Leading dignitaries attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit seemed to have reached a compromise Monday night. Gendarmerie chief Sao Sokha was one of several RCAF deputy supreme commanders attending Chea Dara's presentation. After Hun Sen's July 23, 2015 speech , ostentatious political partisanship by top RCAF and GRK commanders reached new heights and was given high-profile publicity in CPP media. ""In a speech to medical students, he warned that he would have no compunction about using military force against anyone moving to dissolve the National Assembly and the constitution."" Hun Sen in April 1996 told Widyono during a two-hour meeting at his compound in Takhmao that he had acquired a transcript of Ranariddh's speech to his party in Sihanoukville in January and was not impressed.

They shared this with local governors via the latter's chairpersonship of unified command committees with authority over all security forces in their areas of administration. This is now what the CPP is trying to achieve; a mass-movement where the state and civil-society share the party's only doctrine: loyalty to Hun Sen. At dawn on July 5, 1997, Hun Sen's forces launched a coup against their power- sharing partners in a coalition government.

abuse," Abuses since UNTAC (1993-Present)  After the departure of UNTAC in 1993, CPP political violence flared again, including against media critics and the new opposition Khmer Nation Party led by former FUNCINPEC finance minister Sam Rainsy, who was the target of a number of assassination attempts. This danger should be viewed both in light of their long records of violating human rights and in the context of the 2013 national elections and those scheduled for 2018. The report listed hundreds of other cases of SOC abuses , including enforced disappearances and torture. Kieng Savut had a notorious reputation as a CPP henchman and serious human rights abuser . We find it especially disturbing that such grave abuses should occur in the very same week that your officials had invited Amnesty International to visit Cambodia for discussions on human rights with you and other government representatives. They undertook to ""promote and encourage respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cambodia as embodied in the relevant international instruments in order, in particular, to prevent the recurrence of human rights abuses "". This report details the responsibility of 12 of these senior security force officers for human rights abuses in Cambodia from the late 1970s until the present:  Gen. Khmer Rouge-era Abuses The two generals with the longest known records of human rights abuses are Pol Saroeun and Kun Kim. All 12 owe their senior positions in the security forces to personal links to Hun Sen dating back two decades or more, and their willingness to abuse human rights. Khmer Rouge-era Abuses  The two generals with the longest known records of human rights abuses are Pol Saroeun and Kun Kim. Most of the 12 have been implicated in the use of unnecessary, excessive, and sometimes lethal force against protests about unfree and unfair elections, land confiscations, labor abuses , and low wages. For the same reasons, despite gathering evidence of widespread human rights abuses , UNTAC could not penetrate the wall of official impunity. Ten of the 12 officials profiled here are implicated in these abuses via their service in various PRK and SOC (successor to the PRK) political, military, intelligence, and police units, the institutional bases from which they rose to their current prominent security force positions. Many have also been involved in non-political abuses against the ordinary population, such as land takings, murder, torture, and arbitrary detention. Given their past record and current positions, Hun Sen can rely upon these 12 commanders and their subordinates to commit human rights abuses whenever it is considered necessary, including for their own power and economic interests. These abuses were sometimes conducted in coordination with the army and ordinary police in PRK ""mixed force"" formations. We find it especially disturbing that such grave abuses should occur in the very same week that your officials had invited Amnesty International to visit Cambodia for discussions on human rights with you and other government representatives. Instructions to the armed forces to act against the opposition were repeated, at times in even more threatening tones, in 2016, especially after small civil society-led peaceful protests in May against the politically motivated arrest and charging of five human rights defenders in connection with activities aimed at opposing human rights violations . PRK-era and SOC Period Abuses The policies and practices of the Khmer Rouge devastated Cambodian society and created conditions for the success of the Vietnamese invasion in December 1978 and the creation of the PRK in January 1979. It is tragic that the gains made through the transition process in Cambodia should be placed at risk in this way, that ordinary Cambodians are yet again suffering violations of their fundamental human rights, and that developments in Cambodia have again become a threat to stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. You know only too well the spectre of gross human rights violations that haunts Cambodia to this day. The abuses in which the 12 are implicated include violations of human rights, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed from the 1970s to the present. It also appears to violate article 9 of Cambodia's Law on the General Status of Military Personnel of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (1997), which states that ""[m]ilitary personnel shall be neutral in their functions and work activities, and the use of functions/titles and the state's materials for serving any political activities shall be prohibited."" Abuses committed during repression of rising popular dissatisfaction with the PRK and its reliance on Vietnamese backers include arbitrary political detention and routine torture in a provincial prison run under the authority of Pol Saroeun when he was governor there; in the municipal prison of the capital, Phnom Penh, when Neth Savoeun was a senior police officer there; and in the political security apparatus of the Ministry of Interior when Sok Phal was an important cadre there. UNTAC-era Abuses In October 1991, SOC, FUNCINPEC, a second non-communist opposition group (the Khmer People's National Liberation Front), and Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge signed the Paris ""Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict,"" which was also signed by 18 foreign governments. Since then Hun Sen and the CPP have launched an escalating campaign of human rights violations targeting the CNRP and Cambodian media and civil society, claiming this is necessary to prevent any ""color revolution"" that it says might otherwise occur in connection with the 2018 elections, including as a result of protests against fraud.",A0_pag_abuser,capital,A1_ppt_entity_abused,capital

meeting," At a second meeting between the troika and Hun Sen on 3 August, Hun Sen again criticised ASEAN for interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs. At a meeting of representatives of the U.N. The meeting accomplished little, however, with Hun Sen demanding that ASEAN either admit 'his' country by 23 July or 'forget it for the next five or 20 years'. ""Two days after my interview with him, Hun Sen issued a public threat,"" he wrote. In January 1996, Ranariddh held a private meeting of 200 Funcinpec officials in Sihanoukville. Hun Sen in April 1996 told Widyono during a two-hour meeting at his compound in Takhmao that he had acquired a transcript of Ranariddh's speech to his party in Sihanoukville in January and was not impressed.

I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the Kingdom of Cambodia of the cooperation of the ASEAN Secretariat and of our support for the Kingdom of Cambodias active participation in all ASEAN activities. Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP  Making of a strongman: In July 1997, Hun Sen took full control of the country - and his party  Over two days of bloody armed battles 20 years ago today, forces loyal to Hun Sen routed troops supporting Prince Norodom Ranariddh, marking the moment Hun Sen crowned himself Cambodia's supreme leader and decisively quashed any opposition to himself or his party from their royalist rivals. Cambodia's urban and younger voters, increasing as a percentage of the population, have strongly supported the opposition. The return for this Chinese largesse has been Cambodia's reliable support for its foreign policy objectives, most notably in relation to the South China Sea. If anybody does not support the CPP, submit applications of resignation, and I can help you [with that] … But if you are loyal to the CPP you must vote for the CPP, and then you can stay Minister of Social Affairs Vong Sauth  Consider, for instance, Dith Munty, the Supreme Court chief justice who forcibly dissolved the opposition CNRP. And in July, when Ranariddh was accused of moving forces out of Anlong Veng with plans to launch his own coup, he did not need the support of the rest of the party - even if Chea Sim, Sar Kheng, Ke Kim Yan and Defence Minister Tea Banh still opposed a battle. General Pol Saroeun, Kandal Deputy Governor Kun Kim and Phnom Penh Deputy Governor Chea Sophara were reported to support Hun Sen."" ""Officials eat the state's salary, and are asked to be neutral,"" he said, ""but do not forget that the state was born from the party, and I think all of our officials must have the clear character of firmly supporting the party."" Having helped the Khmer Rouge for decades - before, during, and after the period of Pol Pot's rule - Beijing now changed its policy and embarked on support for Hun Sen and the CPP, which continues to the present day. I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the Kingdom of Cambodia of the cooperation of the ASEAN Secretariat and of our support for the Kingdom of Cambodias active participation in all ASEAN activities. It is China's support that has enabled Hun Sen to weather repeated criticisms of his regime while building up the military strength that ensures his survival. The return for this Chinese largesse has been Cambodia's reliable support for its foreign policy objectives, most notably in relation to the South China Sea. At the same time, both parties were actively courting the support of the remaining and heavily armed Khmer Rouge guerrillas still holding out along the Thai border in today's Pailin province and Anlong Veng district in Oddar Meanchey province. The two wanted to change the constitution to allow lawmakers to vote in the entire government at once in a ""package vote"", believing that such a move would provide the needed support for a coalition government. At the same time, a weak reaction would call into question the international community's stated commitment to the Paris agreements and their support for Cambodia's fledgling democracy. Prince Ranariddh, who got away to Thailand the day before the shooting started, finds himself in exile trying to whistle up support from foreign governments. On September 9, 2015, CPP Vice Chairperson Say Chhum secretly instructed that local armed forces who had not already done so must issue public statements of support for Hun Sen's position on border issues. But Mr Hun Sen's advisers are confident such resistance can never flourish without financial and logistical support from outside that other governments seem unlikely to supply. Relations between the two had cooled dramatically since 1993 with Ranariddh seen as unappreciative of past support the Thais had provided to his royalist faction. The strategy emphasized the importance of CPP leaders going down to the grassroots to strengthen and mobilize support for the party. The problem is my people, and whether they support me.""

Hun Sen and the CPP took the opportunity to subvert the GRK for their own political purposes and soon succeeded in making it into their best-trained force for use against their political enemies.

The issued statement reaffirmed a joint commitment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, but considered Hun Sen's use of force 'unfortunate'. The continued Khmer Rouge attacks also made it easier - politically and practically - for the CPP to use violence against the 'opposition' parties as they sought to organise within SoC-controlled areas. After Hun Sen threatened to arrest opposition leader Kem Sokha last year, Khieu Sopheak, the longtime spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said he believed police would use their discretion and not necessarily follow any orders to arrest the CNRP leader.

In the provisional and then constitutional governments of 1993, Ranariddh and Hun Sen were named concurrently as co-supreme commanders of the armed forces and police. Together, the Supreme Commander, a number of deputy supreme commanders, a chief and a number of deputy chiefs of the newly named Mixed General Staff were made the superiors over the Army Command, Navy Command, the Air Force Command, RCAF intervention divisions and brigades, and various Supreme Command staff offices, including its Research and Intelligence Directorate. Kun Kim was appointed Chief of the Mixed General Staff. On January 14, 1985, Hun Sen was named prime minister of what was then called the People's Republic of Kampuchea, a state officially founded in 1979 after Cambodian defectors (including Hun Sen) and Vietnamese troops overthrew the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. A deputy of Kieng Savut, Sao Sokha was appointed as his successor.

At the anniversary ceremony , Rescue Party President Sam Rainsy called on Cambodia's politicians to remember the coup and to see it as a lesson not to take revenge on one another. UNTAC-era Abuses  In October 1991, SOC, FUNCINPEC, a second non-communist opposition group (the Khmer People's National Liberation Front), and Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge signed the Paris ""Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict,"" which was also signed by 18 foreign governments. The announcement, however, said the admission would take place in Hanoi at a ""special ceremony"" arranged by ASEAN foreign ministers. But he said he joined the Rescue Party ceremony ""to pay respect to the souls [of dead soldiers]."" ""Nobody dares to hold this ceremony anymore because they are afraid of Hun Sen,"" he said. Former invitation withdrawn  ASEAN had agreed in 1995 to admit Cambodia, along with Laos and Myanmar, at a ceremony two years later. Noun Chivorn, Charge d Affaires of the Royal Embassy of Cambodia  Distinguished Guests,  Ladies and Gentlemen,    A few moments ago, the ceremony for the admission of the Kingdom of Cambodia into ASEAN was held in Hanoi. Cambodian dancers perform during a ceremony marking the 68th founding anniversary of Cambodian People's Party in Phnom Penh on June 28. The admission was marked by the signing of the Declaration on the Admission of the Kingdom of Cambodia by the Cambodian Senior Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the ASEAN Foreign Ministers. The announcement, however, said the admission would take place in Hanoi at a ""special ceremony "" arranged by ASEAN foreign ministers. Article 6: Upon signature of this accord, the two parties will name their respective representatives to consult and resolve together any problems which might arise during its implementation. At the appointment ceremony , Hun Sen tasked Kim Yan with ending illegal logging within three months - a tall order - with one military analyst suggesting at the time that Kim Yan's new deputies' lack of loyalty showed he was being ""set up for the kill"". The objectives of the CPP and the Khmer Rouge remained incompatible: both only signed the accord under strong international pressure and in the hope that they could twist its ambiguities to their advantage. The admission was marked by the signing of the Declaration on the Admission of the Kingdom of Cambodia by the Cambodian Senior Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the ASEAN Foreign Ministers. The agreements, signed on 23 October 1991, unleashed a rapid series of events which included a short-lived alliance between the CPP and FUNCINPEC (see box): the near-lynching of Khmer Rouge president, Khieu Samphan, by a CPP-organised mob on his arrival in Phnom Penh and the crushing of student demonstrations against SoC corruption. Further Control by the CPP Over the Armed Forces  Though Hun Sen signed the Paris Agreements on behalf of the CPP and committed to ending party control over the armed forces and other state institutions, the CPP has never relinquished control over the military (or police, judicial, or other state officials). UNTAC, the Ministry of Interior, and the Police  A further SOC sub-decree, promulgated immediately after the signing of the October 1991 Paris Agreements, reaffirmed the Ministry of Interior's overall responsibilities for ""defense of political security"" and ""public order,"" but still with virtually no direct authority over sub-national police. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party held a ceremony at its headquarters in Phnom Penh on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the 1997 coup, in which the CPP defeated the royalist Funcinpec, dismantling a power-sharing agreement, installing Hun Sen as the sole prime minister, and leaving many senior royal officials dead.

Background  Cambodian Armed Forces 1978 to Present  Anti-Pol Pot Insurgencies before January 1979  The current Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) of the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) are the successors to the Revolutionary People's Armed Forces of Kampuchea (RPAFK) of the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) set up in 1979 after the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia that precipitated the collapse of the regime of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK, widely referred to as the Khmer Rouge). Human rights considerations should therefore be at the forefront of efforts to restore peace and normalise government in Cambodia. ""The three of us agreed that I would inform the top levels, and I sent a message immediately, and received a phone call from the leader of the government to take urgent action."" Whereas the A3 were established as a militarized force to fight the Khmer Rouge, this new police ""special intervention force"" was established to fight the government 's main and legal political enemies. In September 2017 the Cambodia Daily was forced to close, while in May 2018 the owners of the Phnom Penh Post were coerced by the government into selling the paper to a Malaysian company with ties to Hun Sen.

leadership," ""The ASEAN leaders decided to admit Cambodia into ASEAN as the 10th member, so this is a very clear and definite decision... Right now Cambodia is a member,"" Cam said. This was seen in CPP military circles as ending a period of ""ambiguous commands and orders"" and beginning one of ensuring ""a single competent leadership over the whole country. Over the past year alone the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has been dissolved and the official leader of the party, Kem Sokha, jailed on spurious treason charges. At a time when the Khmer Rouge were fighting a guerrilla war along the Thai border with direct support from Thailand and China and at least indirect support from the United States, the United Kingdom, and others, the constitution defined the RPPK as ""the force directly leading the entirety of the revolutionary tasks"" in the country. However, it granted the prime minister authority to lead Cambodia's military and security work, sharing responsibility for the former with Minister of National Defense Tea Banh but giving new Minister of Interior Sar Kheng (Chea Sim's brother-in-law), an ex-East Zone Khmer Rouge and veteran CPP civilian administrator without security force experience, no responsibility for the latter. A former CPK East Zone Khmer Rouge cadre, Chea Sim was implicated in serious crimes there before crossing into Vietnam in 1978 and becoming involved in opposition to Pol Pot's leadership of the CPK. Prime Minister Hun Sen (left) and royalist Funcinpec party leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh toast an agreement for closer cooperation between their parties in 2001. Party spokesman Phay Siphan described it as a ""bridge linking the party to all citizens so that they understand our political platform and gain confidence in our leadership "". Instead, direct command leadership of RCAF was placed within a newly formed single Supreme Command merging the previous Supreme General Staff into the previous Supreme Command to form a single body headed by the RCAF Supreme Commander. It was also in ""direct command leadership "" of Cambodia's six military regions. It characterized the PRK Council of Ministers—the government—as ""the organ directly managing society and directly leading the strengthening of the national economy."" This was extended after the CPP congress of January-February 2015 to openly carrying out political proselytizing, including promoting Hun Sen's leadership of the CPP, in uniform and among troops in military formation. The Ministry of National Defense remained designated ""to lead and govern over the national defense sector,"" but still without ""direct command leadership "" over military units or bodies commanding such units. Article 19 specified that deputy prime ministers act only in accordance with a non-permanent delegation of prime ministerial authority and make decisions related to the overall leadership of the government only with prime ministerial approval. The first PRK Minister of Interior, the late CPP Chairman Chea Sim, who died in 2015, is credited with taking the lead in setting up and developing this police force. The Cambodian leader did receive some good news on Tuesday, although not from ASEAN. The new deputies included Moul Roeup, the head of the Military Intelligence Department; Chea Dara, the head of the Tactical Department; Sao Sokha, the head of the National Military Police; and Hing Bun Heang, the head of Hun Sen's Bodyguard Unit  Three months later, Kim Yan was placed in charge of the National Authority for Combating Drugs - whose headquarters are inside Kheng's Interior Ministry compound - where he has served ever since, including leading this year's six-month drug crackdown. The Council of Ministers continued to directly govern society and the leadership of national development work.In the military-security sphere, it remained responsible for ""strengthening and increasing the national defense forces,"" ""implementing the gathering up of troop forces,"" and ""taking other necessary measures in order to defend the nation,"" but the new constitution, like the one it replaced, was silent with regard to specific command and control authority. Consensus emerged at the summit of the Asian Regional Forum (ARF) which followed shortly afterwards, bringing together ASEAN countries and dialogue partners including the US, Japan, Russia, China and the European Union, that ASEAN should take the lead in addressing the crisis. On July 29, Chea Dara, an RCAF deputy supreme commander, explained to a meeting of military and police officers that this means they must defend the CPP against the CNRP and maintain Hun Sen in power because ""the army belongs to the CPP,"" and Hun Sen was the person ""rearing, nurturing, leading , and commanding"" it. The Ministry of National Defense remained designated ""to lead and govern over the national defense sector,"" but still without ""direct command leadership"" over military units or bodies commanding such units. In August 1988, by which time Vietnam had withdrawn half its troops and most of its officials from Cambodia, and with the PRK resisting Vietnamese suggestions that it make a peace deal with the Khmer Rouge as well as other Cambodian adversaries, Hun Sen issued a Proclamation making himself, as chairman of the Council of Ministers, ""in charge directly … of the leadership of military and security work,"" while reducing the Minister of Defense to the person in charge only of the construction of military fortifications. With no legal authority and apparently without consulting his son, FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Sihanouk worked with the CPP to be named head of state, prime minister, and Uppermost High (utdam … choan kpuoh) Commander of the Cambodian National Armed Forces. A prime ministerial sub-decree dated November 24, 1993 affirmed the existence of six military regions ""placed under the direct command leadership of the Supreme General Staff"" and military operational sectors ""directly under"" these regions. The founding leader of the CNRP, Sam Rainsy, was convicted yet again on trumped-up charges in multiple criminal cases; to avoid imprisonment he has been in exile since 2015. This set-up was operationalized via a series of administrative laws affirming that the Supreme General Staff was in ""direct command leadership "" of various intervention divisions and brigades, including elite units based around Phnom Penh, such as Brigade 70 and Brigade 911. Municipal and provincial GRK general staffs commanding gendarmes were placed under the ""direct command leadership "" of the GRK national headquarters, while having control of gendarmes established at the district and eventually, it was envisaged, the commune levels.

In this context, a July 20, 1994 Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Council of Ministers specified in its article 2 that the government ""governs, commands , and utilizes the military, police, and other armed forces and the administration of their conduct of activities."" Speaking without specifying singular or plural at a time when Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen were First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, with equal powers in a coalition government, article 9 empowered the prime minister(s) to "" command all activities of the Royal Government in every sphere."" The Ministry of National Defense remained designated ""to lead and govern over the national defense sector,"" but still without ""direct command leadership"" over military units or bodies commanding such units. Similarly, although it is ""subordinated"" to the Supreme Command, it retains "" command and control of all forces,"" including those of the military regions, and is the structure directly responsible for ""cooperating with [other] security forces to protect and maintain social order."" Although formally a part of the post-election Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) answering to its command body, the Supreme General Staff, the GRK was autonomous from it and ""placed under the direct command of the Prime Minister(s),"" on whose authority the scope of their activities was determined. However, sub-national armed forces were concurrently under a system of ""unified command committees"" chaired by local party and administrative heads responsible for their operations in tandem with police and militia. This was seen in CPP military circles as ending a period of ""ambiguous commands and orders"" and beginning one of ensuring ""a single competent leadership over the whole country. It made the Chairperson of a PRK Council of State the Supreme Commander of the armed forces but stipulated no command authorities. The arrangement within the military-defense realm, as described by Pol Saroeun, is that the Supreme Command is formally ""a top institution within the hierarchy of RCAF"" and ""a base for coordination between the general staff and the Ministry of National Defense,"" but the "" command of the entire forces"" remained the ""responsibility of the general staff."" Article 9 empowered the prime minister(s) to "" command all activities of the Royal Government in every sphere."" A prime ministerial sub-decree dated November 24, 1993 affirmed the existence of six military regions ""placed under the direct command leadership of the Supreme General Staff"" and military operational sectors ""directly under"" these regions. The CPP legal interpretation of this law has ever since put the prime minister in ""direct command "" of the police and armed forces. After taking office, Hun Sen further strengthened the authority of the Supreme General Staff via a sub-decree reiterating that it had command over the whole of the PRK armed forces. As Chairman of the national GRK General Staff with direct command over the national mobile intervention gendarmes, which included infantry, armor and motorcycle squadrons, Sao Sokha gained increased political favor from Hun Sen, especially after he personally arrested key CPP security force officers who unsuccessfully tried to stage a coup to oust Hun Sen and Ranariddh on July 2, 1994. The Ministry of Interior lost the power to command sub-national police, retaining only such tasks as training them and inspecting their work. Although formally a part of the post-election Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) answering to its command body, the Supreme General Staff, the GRK was autonomous from it and ""placed under the direct command of the Prime Minister(s),"" on whose authority the scope of their activities was determined. However, in line with the general principle that the ""king reigns but does not rule,"" the constitution also stipulated that these armed forces were under the command of supreme (akkeak) commander(s) separately appointed. Under prime ministerial command , gendarmes were also authorized to provide forces to carry out their powers at the request of the ministry of interior, ministry of national defense and other ministries, including via special military operations. Its position was further enhanced because of the crucial role GRK forces, especially those commanded by Sao Sokha, played in Hun Sen's July 1997 coup against FUNCINPEC. Hun Sen's continuing ultimate command authority over the RCAF was demonstrated at a gathering he convened on July 23, 2015 at his personal headquarters at Tuol Krasang in Kandal province of almost 5,000 senior army, gendarme, navy, air force, and police officers from all over Cambodia. The GRK was formally inaugurated in November 1993, under the command of Keo Samuon, with Sao Sokha as his sole deputy. A 2013 government defense strategic review noted that the 1999 restructuring of its top command structure left in place a number of ""overlapping roles, responsibilities and nomenclature within job titles"" and a lack of definition with regard to the order of battle. Pol Saroeun, as chief of staff, enjoyed de jure command authority over the whole of the PRK armed forces and was de facto the most powerful military figure, next to Hun Sen himself. This was just one part of a larger command structure headed by Vietnamese army officers. It stated that the PRK Council of Ministers governed only in the economic and social spheres, without mentioning any command authority over army and other forces. The CPP legal interpretation of this law has ever since put Hun Sen in ""direct command "" of the armed forces and police. Article 2 of the July 20, 1994 Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Council of Ministers specified that the government ""governs, commands, and utilizes the military, police, and other armed forces and the administration of their conduct of activities."" On July 29, Chea Dara, an RCAF deputy supreme commander, explained to a meeting of military and police officers that this means they must defend the CPP against the CNRP and maintain Hun Sen in power because ""the army belongs to the CPP,"" and Hun Sen was the person ""rearing, nurturing, leading, and commanding "" it. The RGC Ministry of Interior and Police Now  Legally and practically, Supreme Commissioner of National Police Neth Savoeun shares operational command authority over center-level police with Em Sam-an. This set-up was operationalized via a series of administrative laws affirming that the Supreme General Staff was in ""direct command leadership"" of various intervention divisions and brigades, including elite units based around Phnom Penh, such as Brigade 70 and Brigade 911. However, a review of CPP-controlled and CPP-friendly media since 2012 demonstrates that within the existing Supreme Command/Mixed General Staff, chief of staff Kun Kim functions de facto as the predominant command authority over RCAF. Article 2 of the July 20, 1994 Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Council of Ministers specified that the government ""governs, commands , and utilizes the military, police, and other armed forces and the administration of their conduct of activities."" Nationally, the membership incorporates both ex-military and ex-police who officially participate in its activities under such regular security force command authority.

""My personal point of view is that if [we] arrest Mr Kem Sokha, it will be a loss to the national interest,"" Sopheak said on June 3, 2016, explaining that such an arrest could create turmoil if protests broke out. The process was supposed to be managed by an UNTAC- created Mixed Military Working Group (MMWG) with participation by CPAF and the armed forces of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge and non-communist opponents of CPP, most notably the royalist FUNCINPEC. Cambodian Police, 1979 to Present  PRK Ministry of Interior and Police  Institutionally, the foundation of today's Cambodian police is dated to January 7, 1979, when the PRK was created . The PRK Combat Police, created in March 1986 and operational until November 1991, committed many politically motivated extrajudicial executions during counter-insurgency actions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In April 2014 a major structural initiative created two new supreme directorates: one for immigration (i.e., control over foreigners) headed by Gen. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, have agreed as follows:  Article 1: The two parties agree to cooperate fully in creating conditions favouring the accomplishment of H.R.H. Pol Saroeun, among other senior officers, that ""the opposition"" was responsible for efforts to create instability. France's goal was to create a politically neutral and highly professionalized security force answerable to Sihanouk. This and attendant documents (the ""Paris Agreements"") mandated the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to demobilize most of Cambodia's various armed forces and establish direct control over key sectors of its various existing administrative organizations in order to create a neutral political environment for UN-organized elections, which were held in May 1993. While Hun Sen has orchestrated repression, he has remained in power by creating a cadre of ruthless members of the security forces to implement his vision and orders. All this is intended to create the sense amongst the public that there is no welfare state in Cambodia, only a philanthropic party - the CPP.

A one-party state, the PRK established and enforced its rule through widespread political imprisonment without charge or trial and a system of torture of thousands of political detainees, many of whom died from such ill-treatment and abysmal detention conditions. Being sent to court was used as a threat against those prisoners who did not break under torture : police told those in their custody that unless they took the opportunity to ""confess,"" a revolutionary people's tribunal would sentence them to extraordinary long periods of imprisonment or even death. Such police repression was carried out via routine abuse of human rights, including torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, prolonged arbitrary detention without charge or trial, or unfair trials. Many have also been involved in non-political abuses against the ordinary population, such as land takings, murder, torture , and arbitrary detention. One unit in particular, the '911' parachute regiment under Colonel Chap Pheakadey, was clearly responsible for a series of executions and torture ,"" he said.

This was seen in CPP military circles as ending a period of ""ambiguous commands and orders"" and beginning one of ensuring ""a single competent leadership over the whole country. ""July 1997 marked the beginning of Hun Sen's Cambodia as we know it today,"" author and journalist Sebastian Strangio said in an email, noting that the 1997 fighting not only ended Prince Ranariddh's challenge to Hun Sen's power, but also that coming from within his party. But until business as usual ends , they will never be in charge,"" he says. On January 3, it was Sao Sokha's Military Police who killed at least five protesting workers on Phnom Penh's Veng Sreng Boulevard, bringing the strikes to a swift end . A year later, then-Phnom Penh Municipal Governor Pa Socheatvong, another Hun Sen loyalist, described the decision to end the months of protests at a Military Police event the following year. The fighting of early July has ended in the capital, and Angkor Wat appears secure, too. Moreover, at the end of October, Cambodia's head of state - King Sihanouk - abruptly departed for China when Hun Sen rebuffed his efforts to mediate in the crisis. This, however, did not end electoral and popular challenges to Hun Sen and the CPP's political dominance, nor stem their growing reliance for power on economic practices characterized by elite land-grabbing and exploitation of low-wage factory workers. Even though factional fighting has ended , she said, the possibility of banditry seems to have grown. Further Control by the CPP Over the Armed Forces  Though Hun Sen signed the Paris Agreements on behalf of the CPP and committed to ending party control over the armed forces and other state institutions, the CPP has never relinquished control over the military (or police, judicial, or other state officials). At the appointment ceremony, Hun Sen tasked Kim Yan with ending illegal logging within three months - a tall order - with one military analyst suggesting at the time that Kim Yan's new deputies' lack of loyalty showed he was being ""set up for the kill"". The Military Police also surrounded Phnom Penh's Freedom Park on January 4 as scores of thugs carrying crude weapons swarmed CNRP supporters encamped there, violently ending months of peaceful protests. Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry, responded that the cash payments were ""government money"" - an observation that shows even senior officials don't understand where state money begins and party funds end . Cambodia was already a full member, said Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam at the end of the first day of the annual summit on Monday. ''I don't worry, because by the end of the year everything will be normal,'' he said, ''even better than before.''

transport," CBG transports ore for export by train, but villagers located close to active mines operated by both CBG and SMB remain concerned about air quality, as do those in residential neighborhoods close to a CBG processing plant where bauxite is crushed and dried. The dust blown from open-sky bauxite mines and storage areas and displaced from the roads on which the ore is transported is not normally more toxic than other forms of dust. The dust produced by bauxite mining and transport smothers fields and enters homes, leaving families and health workers worried that reduced air quality threatens their health and environment. Large amounts of high quality iron ore remain un-exploited due to the logistical difficulty of transporting ore to ports. Once excavated, bauxite is transported to ports for export along specially-constructed mining roads, which are largely unpaved, with hundreds of lorries traveling to and from the consortium's mines each day. A network of mining roads and railways, used to transport bauxite to ports, crisscross once isolated rural communities. The bauxite is then loaded by excavators onto trucks and taken to a storage location before being transported by specially-constructed railways or mining roads to ports. CBG uses a 125-kilometer rail line to transport bauxite from the mines around Sangaredi to a deep-sea port in Kamsar, at the mouth of the Rio Nunez river. Do not approve ESIAs unless they include quantitative estimates of the impact of mining operations, including the transport of bauxite, on air quality. An April 2017 government inspection concluded that, ""SMB has not taken any effective measure to reduce pollution of surface water by the transport of sediments into waterways that renders them murky and further contaminates them.""

Partner with international public health experts to improve the BGEEE's capacity to conduct air quality monitoring , including by improving the equipment used for monitoring and significantly increasing the frequency of monitoring. In Boundou Waadé, an adjacent community to Hamdallaye that was also established before CBG's arrival , satellite imagery shows how the village has been progressively surrounded by CBG's mines since approximately 2000. After initially operating with far from adequate mitigation measures for limiting dust emissions, SMB significantly lowered dust levels on its mining roads in the 2018 dry season by more frequently watering its mining roads. These texts, which should be developed in consultation with civil society and affected communities, should: Monitor and protect access to clean water: Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. CBG transports ore for export by train, but villagers located close to active mines operated by both CBG and SMB remain concerned about air quality, as do those in residential neighborhoods close to a CBG processing plant where bauxite is crushed and dried. This legal advice should discuss: the government and mining companies' obligations during the ESIA process; how communities can provide input into the ESIA process, as well as how communities can challenge the arrival of mining operations in their locality; the steps that communities or individuals with customary land tenure can take to protect their property rights. Once mining begins, environment ministry officials said that they can in theory refuse to renew a company's environmental certificate, required to operate in Guinea, where deficiencies are identified. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. These texts, which should be developed in consultation with civil society and affected communities, should: Monitor and protect access to clean water: Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. Improve internal monitoring of social and environmental impacts: Ensure that existing community relations teams and health, safety and environment staff are adequately staffed, resourced and trained to effectively monitor the environmental, social and human rights impacts of mining. Monitor and protect air quality : Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. CBG began comprehensive air quality monitoring in 2017 and has not yet released updated public data, although it told Human Rights Watch in July 2018 that its monitoring shows that air quality, including particulate matter, is within the highest-level targets established by the WHO. The SMB consortium has expanded rapidly since it began operating in 2015 and is already Guinea's biggest exporter. Human Rights Watch visited four villages around Sangaredi-Hamdallaye, Boundou Waadé, Danta Fonye and Kogon Lengue-where community leaders said they had lost significant portions of their ancestral lands to mining; two more recent settlements, Kankalaré I and II, that CBG relocated in 2017 and early 2018; and three other villages, Parawol, Fassaly Foutabé and M'Bororé, who stand to lose land as CBG's operations expand. Residents who stand to lose land as CBG's operations expand expressed fears of the impact on their own livelihoods. But SMB, which conducted little or no monitoring of water quality or availability during the first three years it operated , lacks the data needed to support the contention that its operations have not affected access to water. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Baseline monitoring of water levels and quality before mining operations begin, including mapping of existing surface and underground water sources, as well as a comprehensive monitoring plan once mining operations begin. Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. Satellite imagery reviewed by Human Rights Watch shows that since 2005, CBG has expropriated some 10 square kilometers of Hamdallaye's ancestral farmlands, or around 40% of the land, taking land for open-sky mines and, since 2016, to build a bauxite storage area and new sections of railway and roads to expand its operations . Since it began exporting bauxite in 1973, CBG has progressively excavated and mined large tracts of land surrounding the town of Sangaredi, where its mining operations are concentrated, moving between different pits to find the necessary quality of bauxite to meet suppliers' demands. The China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters has published voluntary Guidelines for Social Responsibility in Outbound Mining Investments that are targeted at mining projects that Chinese companies invest in. Guinea's government told Human Rights Watch that, in view of the potential human rights issues associated with mining, the government ""utilizes fully its state power to ensure Guinean laws [relating to the mining sector] are respected and to oversee the activities of mining companies."" : Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining , publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. Loss of Land and Livelihoods  Dozens of farmers from 16 villages located near mines, ports and mining roads described how mining companies have expropriated ancestral farmlands without adequate compensation or in exchange for financial payments that don't replace the benefits families and communities derived from land. Such measures included working with Guinean female researchers and interpreters, meeting with women individually and in groups to explain the aims of the research and seeking advice from experts on gender and mining . If necessary for public health or to protect access to water, suspend mining activities until the problem has been addressed. ""We wanted mining activities to begin first, while there was a lack of supply [from other countries] in the market, while at least ensuring the minimum legal rights were protected from the beginning,"" said Saadou Nimaga, secretary general of the ministry of mines. Conduct independent monitoring : Commission independent monitors, paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors. But in six of the rural villages that surround CBG's mines in Sangaredi, residents said that years of mining have damaged local rivers and streams. Riots broke out in Boké in April and September 2017, due to anger at inadequate local services, particularly a lack of water and electricity, resentment at the rapid expansion of mining and broader concerns about the impacts of mining on local communities. The memorandum referenced a lack of drinking water and electricity in Boké, and referred to the impact of mining on health, livelihoods and the environment, decrying ""the destruction of forests, biodiversity, grazing fields and agricultural land from clearing and exploitation by mining…the pollution of the environment which affects the health of the population…the inadequacy of social structures in view of the growing population,"" and ""the systematic exclusion of affected populations from the financial benefits of mining exploitation."" We used satellite imagery to assess how mining has affected land use and to understand when mining projects began construction and exploitation. Where government or company monitoring suggests mining is impacting access to clean water, ensure companies take immediate steps to address the cause. Reduced Access to Water  Unless managed appropriately, studies show that bauxite mining will have significant impacts on the hydrology of the surrounding landscape. In SMB's case, the government took shortcuts during the approval process for new projects to ensure mining started quickly, prioritizing investment over a comprehensive analysis of social and environmental risks. Initiate a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the environmental, social and human rights impact of bauxite mining in the Boké region. Access to Remedies  Community leaders told Human Rights Watch that mining companies often do not promptly or meaningfully respond to their complaints about the impacts of bauxite mining on their land, livelihoods, health and water sources. Improve transparency: Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining . Human Rights Watch typically began visits to communities, including repeat visits, with a group interview with community leaders, before conducting individual interviews with community members impacted by mining , including women. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Baseline monitoring of water levels and quality before mining operations begin, including mapping of existing surface and underground water sources, as well as a comprehensive monitoring plan once mining operations begin. Conduct independent monitoring: Commission independent monitors, paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors. Commission independent monitors, paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors. To Companies Sourcing Bauxite from Guinea  Establish a thorough due diligence process, including regular monitoring , to ensure that exporters respect the rights of communities where mining occurs. Prior to obtaining government approval for a mining project, the 2011 mining code requires mining companies to submit an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) that examines the likely consequences of mining on local communities. Require companies to conduct monitoring of water levels and quality that meets industry best practices and to publish the data. SMB told Human Rights Watch that the consortium has built or repaired 120 boreholes in local communities and said that it is only aware of one location in which mining had damaged local waterways, where the situation had been quickly remedied. In April and September 2017, Boké was paralyzed by riots, as thousands of young people ransacked government buildings and stopped mining companies from operating . Where government or company monitoring suggests mining is impacting access to clean water, ensure companies take immediate steps to address the cause. Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. In 2009, as part of a directive designed to harmonize standards regulating mining in West Africa, the West African regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), declared that states and mining companies have an ""obligation to respect and promote recognized human rights including the rights of women, children and workers arising from mining activities."" Improve transparency: Publish environmental and social impact assessments, environmental and social management plans and periodic environment monitoring reports. Scores of residents told Human Rights Watch that they believe that mining had reduced water levels and quality in the local rivers, streams and wells that they rely on for washing, cooking and drinking, threatening the access to water of thousands of people. Monitor and protect air quality : Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining , publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UN CESCR), the committee of experts that monitors the implementation of the ICESCR, has stated that this requires states to take measures to prevent pollution by third parties, such as mining companies. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Monitor and protect air quality: Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. The SMB consortium's ports are principally operated by consortium member and shipping company Winning International Group, while road transport is led by consortium member United Mining Services International. Riots broke out in Boké in April and September 2017, due to anger at inadequate local services, particularly a lack of water and electricity, resentment at the rapid expansion of mining and broader concerns about the impacts of mining on local communities. : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations.

Conduct independent monitoring: Commission independent monitors, paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors. Ensure that individuals with customary land tenure, and occupants of land who have planted crops or built infrastructure on land, are adequately compensated where land is acquired for mining and that their living standards are not negatively impacted. The Guinean government has, since the passage of the 2011 mining code, failed to pass regulations establishing compensation standards for land acquisitions in the mining sector-a missed opportunity to provide clearer protection to rural farmers and communities. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Baseline monitoring of water levels and quality before mining operations begin, including mapping of existing surface and underground water sources, as well as a comprehensive monitoring plan once mining operations begin. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Monitor and protect air quality: Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. If necessary for public health, suspend mining activities until the source of emissions has been addressed. ""As we lose our land, we're forced to more frequently farm other areas, and so our land is becoming less productive,"" said a farmer from Hamdallaye, a village where satellite imagery shows that the community has lost 40 percent of its ancestral lands to CBG's mining activities . To enable civil society organizations to supplement government oversight, the government should ensure greater transparency in the sector, including by requiring publication of environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs), environmental and social management plans (ESMPs), government and company periodic monitoring reports, and public data-from both companies and the government-on the health and environmental impacts of mining. Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. Communities where the SMB consortium operates said that, while community relations staff meets frequently with residents, these meetings rarely lead to action to address complaints. Assist the Guinean government to develop a public health response to the impact of its operations on air quality that is proportionate to, and addresses, the impacts of its activities. Monitor and protect access to clean water: Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Thousands of young people ransacked government buildings and erected informal checkpoints, preventing mining companies from operating . In 2009, as part of a directive designed to harmonize standards regulating mining in West Africa, the West African regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), declared that states and mining companies have an ""obligation to respect and promote recognized human rights including the rights of women, children and workers arising from mining activities ."" But SMB, which conducted little or no monitoring of water quality or availability during the first three years it operated, lacks the data needed to support the contention that its operations have not affected access to water. Overview  The sector with the most potential is mining . Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Guinea's government told Human Rights Watch that, in view of the potential human rights issues associated with mining, the government ""utilizes fully its state power to ensure Guinean laws [relating to the mining sector] are respected and to oversee the activities of mining companies."" Improve monitoring of mining companies : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( Bureau Guinéen d'Etudes et d'Evaluation Environnementale (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations. Do not approve ESIAs unless they include quantitative estimates of the impact of mining operations , including the transport of bauxite, on air quality. Increase the number and capacity of trained staff in the Ministry of Environment and BGEEE able to analyze ESIAs, monitor compliance reports, and form inspection teams to verify that companies adhere fully to their environmental and social obligations. Strengthen the capacity of staff to oversee currently-neglected impacts of mining , such as the consequences of resettlement and land expropriations. Eric Humphery-Smith, Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, said: ""For the country's booming mining sector, the situation could not come at a worse time. Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Until 2017, CBG did not deploy the necessary monitoring tools-such as a model tracking the impact of mining on the flow of local rivers, streams and groundwater-to adequately track the impact of mining on water levels. CBG began comprehensive air quality monitoring in 2017 and has not yet released updated public data, although it told Human Rights Watch in July 2018 that its monitoring shows that air quality, including particulate matter, is within the highest-level targets established by the WHO.

""Even our saliva has changed color due to the dust,"" said a woman from a village adjacent to a mining road. Although women are acutely impacted by loss of land to mining , reduced access to water, and concerns over health, strong social norms that discourage women from equal participation in village governance mean that women face barriers in lodging complaints. Regulatory Framework  National Law  Although neither Guinea's 2011 mining code nor its 1989 environment code explicitly mention human rights, they both impose obligations on companies to avoid or remedy the negative social and environmental impacts of mining . Operationalize Prefectural Committees for Environmental and Social Supervision (Comités Préfectoraux de Suivi Environnemental et Social (CPSES)) by providing the equipment and funding, from mining companies if appropriate, needed for CPSES members to conduct site visits every quarter to each company operating in their locality. Monitor the impact of land acquisitions on communities' livelihoods and living standards and provide additional assistance if over time monitoring shows communities have been negatively impacted. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Baseline monitoring of water levels and quality before mining operations begin, including mapping of existing surface and underground water sources, as well as a comprehensive monitoring plan once mining operations begin. Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining . All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Baseline monitoring of water levels and quality before mining operations begin, including mapping of existing surface and underground water sources, as well as a comprehensive monitoring plan once mining operations begin. Bauxite, iron ore, gold, and diamond mining represent key markets for Guinea and relatively well developed with tens of foreign companies actively producing and exporting minerals. If necessary for public health, suspend mining activities until the source of emissions has been addressed. Monitor and protect air quality : Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. Mining will in 2019 also force the community to relocate their homes, although the community hopes to continue to farm the land that has so far been spared by mining. Boké: The Explosive Center of Guinea's Bauxite Industry  Bauxite mining has made the Boké region, which is in lower Guinea (La Basse Guinée), along the country's western coast and bordering Guinea Bissau, the center of Guinea's mining -driven economic growth. Where government or company monitoring suggests that levels of particulate matter or other emissions exceed the World Health Organizations' recommended levels, ensure companies take immediate steps to address the source of the emissions. Mining has long been a major contributor to the Guinean economy, with mining revenues making up almost 20 percent of Guinea's gross domestic product and almost 90 percent of its exports in 2014. The dust produced by bauxite mining and transport smothers fields and enters homes, leaving families and health workers worried that reduced air quality threatens their health and environment. While some men can at least obtain jobs at mining companies to replace lost income, women are rarely employed by mining companies, even though they are often responsible for finding alternative sources of food where land is lost to mining . The responsibility for monitoring the impact of mining on local water sources, however, belongs to mining companies, not local communities. Guinea's government told Human Rights Watch that, in view of the potential human rights issues associated with mining, the government ""utilizes fully its state power to ensure Guinean laws [relating to the mining sector] are respected and to oversee the activities of mining companies."" But SMB, which conducted little or no monitoring of water quality or availability during the first three years it operated, lacks the data needed to support the contention that its operations have not affected access to water. To the Government of Guinea's International Partners  Provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen robust environmental, social and human rights monitoring in the extractive industries. Ensure that clients provide replacement land or livelihood restoration assistance to landowners or occupants who lose land to mining . Respect rural land rights : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining , fair compensation is paid, including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. CBG said it is now developing the monitoring tools that will allow the company to understand the impact of mining on local water sources. The protests demonstrated deep-rooted anger driven by a perception that Boké residents had not only insufficiently benefited from mining but also endured the negative impact of mining on people's livelihoods, health and environment. To Companies Sourcing Bauxite from Guinea  Establish a thorough due diligence process, including regular monitoring, to ensure that exporters respect the rights of communities where mining occurs. The memorandum referenced a lack of drinking water and electricity in Boké, and referred to the impact of mining on health, livelihoods and the environment, decrying ""the destruction of forests, biodiversity, grazing fields and agricultural land from clearing and exploitation by mining …the pollution of the environment which affects the health of the population…the inadequacy of social structures in view of the growing population,"" and ""the systematic exclusion of affected populations from the financial benefits of mining exploitation.""

As well as monitoring the impact of individual mining projects, monitor and publicly report on the cumulative impacts of mining on the environment and livelihoods, including impacts exacerbated by climate change. The SMB consortium operates two ports, one in Katougouma, serving mines like that at Dabis about 35 kilometers northwest from Boké, and another at Dapilon, serving mines like those around Malapouya, 20 kilometers northeast of Boké. While some men can at least obtain jobs at mining companies to replace lost income, women are rarely employed by mining companies, even though they are often responsible for finding alternative sources of food where land is lost to mining . The Guidelines state that companies should ""ensure that all operations shall be in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights during the entire life-cycle of the mining project."" The protests demonstrated deep-rooted anger driven by a perception that Boké residents had not only insufficiently benefited from mining but also endured the negative impact of mining on people's livelihoods, health and environment. Until 2017, CBG did not deploy the necessary monitoring tools-such as a model tracking the impact of mining on the flow of local rivers, streams and groundwater-to adequately track the impact of mining on water levels. The mining code states that the arrival of a mining project does not extinguish property rights and that, ""no right to prospect or operate is valid without the consent of the individual with property rights or his or her successors, with regard to activities involving the surface or affecting it. ""[91] Where a mining company cannot obtain consent, the mining code does give the state the right to require mining to occur, but only after adequate compensation is paid. Once mining begins, the BGEEE also conducts annual inspections of mining companies, which help the environment ministry to decide whether to reissue each year a company's Certificate of Environmental Conformity, which is, in theory, required for the company to continue operating each year. Partner with international public health experts to improve the BGEEE's capacity to conduct air quality monitoring, including by improving the equipment used for monitoring and significantly increasing the frequency of monitoring. The responsibility for monitoring the impact of mining on local water sources, however, belongs to mining companies, not local communities. © 2018 Ricci Shryock for Human Rights Watch  Communities said that the effect of land losses was exacerbated by the impact of mining projects on other sources of income, like fishing, as well as the consequences of the dust from SMB's operations on the productivity of remaining agricultural land. A joint ministry of mines and ministry of environment inspection in February 2018, the middle of the dry season, recorded levels of fine particulate matter well above the levels recommended by the WHO in four villages near SMB's operations . Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. If necessary for public health, suspend mining activities until the source of emissions has been addressed. Monitor the impact of land acquisitions on communities' livelihoods and living standards and provide additional assistance if over time monitoring shows communities have been negatively impacted. Finally, they should ensure that their staff are adequately resourced and trained to effectively monitor the impacts of mining and establish effective grievance mechanisms to remedy adverse consequences. Human Rights Watch visited four villages around Sangaredi-Hamdallaye, Boundou Waadé, Danta Fonye and Kogon Lengue-where community leaders said they had lost significant portions of their ancestral lands to mining ; two more recent settlements, Kankalaré I and II, that CBG relocated in 2017 and early 2018; and three other villages, Parawol, Fassaly Foutabé and M'Bororé, who stand to lose land as CBG's operations expand. They say they take steps to mitigate the impact of mining on local water sources and highlight their work to build boreholes and wells in mining-affected communities. Operationalize Prefectural Committees for Environmental and Social Supervision (Comités Préfectoraux de Suivi Environnemental et Social (CPSES)) by providing the equipment and funding, from mining companies if appropriate, needed for CPSES members to conduct site visits every quarter to each company operating in their locality. These texts, which should be developed in consultation with civil society and affected communities, should: Monitor and protect access to clean water: Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. As well as monitoring the impact of individual mining projects, monitor and publicly report on the cumulative impacts of mining on the environment and livelihoods, including impacts exacerbated by climate change. The consortium told Human Rights Watch it began a water quality and availability monitoring program in 2018. Implement land reform to protect customary land rights : As part of a wider land reform process, urgently take action to identify, secure and demarcate customary land rights, particularly in areas where mining exploitation is planned. International financial institutions, including the IFC, should ensure companies meet the standards required by loan agreements, including through regular monitoring of compliance and, where necessary, appropriate sanctions. Communities in the Boké region also told Human Rights Watch that the expropriation of land for mining or mining infrastructure had prevented communities from accessing streams and natural springs where they previously found water, while an influx of people seeking jobs in mines increased pressure on remaining water resources. Monitor and protect air quality : Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. Ensure that existing community relations teams and health, safety and environment staff are adequately staffed, resourced and trained to effectively monitor the environmental, social and human rights impacts of mining. Organizations in countries where multinational companies are headquartered have also developed non-binding standards which recommend that multinationals, including mining companies, respect human rights in the countries where they are operating . The Guinean government conducts only a very limited number of air quality measurements for each company each year, but in some cases, particularly in SMB's concession, the monitoring suggests at worst a potentially serious risk to public health and at best an urgent need for improved monitoring by mining companies and the government. Develop regulations on land acquisitions in the mining sector : Draft and adopt regulations describing the process to be followed to resettle and compensate communities who lose land to mining , whether homes or agricultural land. ""We wanted mining activities to begin first, while there was a lack of supply [from other countries] in the market, while at least ensuring the minimum legal rights were protected from the beginning,"" said Saadou Nimaga, secretary general of the ministry of mines. ""As we lose our land, we're forced to more frequently farm other areas, and so our land is becoming less productive,"" said a farmer from Hamdallaye, a village where satellite imagery shows that the community has lost 40 percent of its ancestral lands to CBG's mining activities. Mining will in 2019 also force the community to relocate their homes, although the community hopes to continue to farm the land that has so far been spared by mining . Monitor and protect access to clean water: Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Communities as yet untouched by mining are concerned that their land is also at risk. Human Rights Watch interviewed over 300 residents who have lost land to privately-owned mining developments. Villagers, many of whom said they believe mining is already contributing to respiratory illnesses, worry about longer-term health impacts. Improve internal monitoring of social and environmental impacts: Ensure that existing community relations teams and health, safety and environment staff are adequately staffed, resourced and trained to effectively monitor the environmental, social and human rights impacts of mining . Improve monitoring of mining companies : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( Bureau Guinéen d'Etudes et d'Evaluation Environnementale (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations. Thousands of young people ransacked government buildings and erected informal checkpoints, preventing mining companies from operating. Commission independent monitors , paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors. Conduct independent monitoring: Commission independent monitors , paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors. : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations. If necessary for public health or to protect access to water, suspend mining activities until the problem has been addressed. Guinea's government told Human Rights Watch that, in view of the potential human rights issues associated with mining , the government ""utilizes fully its state power to ensure Guinean laws [relating to the mining sector] are respected and to oversee the activities of mining companies."" Since it began exporting bauxite in 1973, CBG has progressively excavated and mined large tracts of land surrounding the town of Sangaredi, where its mining operations are concentrated, moving between different pits to find the necessary quality of bauxite to meet suppliers' demands. Redo impact assessments that did not involve effective consultation with local communities or which did not adequately assess or propose mitigation for the environmental and social consequences of mining . Mining has long been a major contributor to the Guinean economy, with mining revenues making up almost 20 percent of Guinea's gross domestic product and almost 90 percent of its exports in 2014. The SMB consortium's mines and infrastructure have expanded particularly rapidly since it began operating in 2015, and on several occasions Human Rights Watch researchers returned to a village after only a few months to find that SMB had added a new mining site. ""Now the mine has arrived , our fields are covered in dust,"" said one villager, who showed Human Rights Watch researchers trees and crops covered in a layer of red dirt. Damage to water sources that residents attribute to mining , as well as increased demand due to population migration to mining sites, reduces communities' access to water for drinking, washing and cooking. Improve monitoring of mining companies : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( Bureau Guinéen d'Etudes et d'Evaluation Environnementale (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations. Improve internal monitoring of social and environmental impacts: Ensure that existing community relations teams and health, safety and environment staff are adequately staffed, resourced and trained to effectively monitor the environmental, social and human rights impacts of mining. : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations . Where land is acquired for mining , work with clients to ensure that fair compensation is paid to individuals with legal and customary land tenure, including for the value of land. The SMB consortium's mines and infrastructure have expanded particularly rapidly since it began operating in 2015, and on several occasions Human Rights Watch researchers returned to a village after only a few months to find that SMB had added a new mining site. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Monitor and protect air quality: Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining , publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. Recommendations  To the Government of Guinea  Strengthen the approval process for new mining projects: Only approve proposed extractive industries projects where applicants' have adequately assessed human rights, social and environmental risks and demonstrated their ability to protect communities from negative impacts. In April and September 2017, Boké was paralyzed by riots, as thousands of young people ransacked government buildings and stopped mining companies from operating. Until 2017, CBG did not deploy the necessary monitoring tools-such as a model tracking the impact of mining on the flow of local rivers, streams and groundwater-to adequately track the impact of mining on water levels. To Mining Companies  Address weaknesses in past ESIAs: Redo impact assessments that did not involve effective consultation with local communities or which did not adequately assess or propose mitigation for the environmental and social consequences of mining . Threats to Health from Reduced Air Quality  Scores of residents from the Boké region described how their lives had been blighted by the dust produced by the mining and transport of bauxite, with red dust entering villages and homes and covering crops. Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining , publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. Doctors and health workers who spoke to Human Rights Watch said that, given the absence of public air quality monitoring data by mining companies and the lack of reliable local government health statistics, it is impossible to draw firm conclusions on potential associations between mining and respiratory illnesses. While mining has brought thousands of jobs to the Boké region, residents of rural villages said that jobs in the mining sector cannot offset the food and income that the community previously derived from land. Furthermore, where CBG does rehabilitate land after mining activities are completed, typically by replacing top soil and replanting trees, community leaders said that the land is not returned to the family or community that previously owned or exploited it. Summary  Bauxite mining in Guinea, one of the world's poorest countries, is booming. Dozens of farmers said that the impact of loss of land has been compounded by the damage caused by mining to remaining farmland, and other sources of livelihood, like fishing. Companies should provide replacement land or livelihood restoration assistance to households who lose land to mining , ensuring that any financial compensation is provided in a way that promotes economic self-sufficiency. Ensure all monitoring includes detailed consideration of impacts on women. Monitor and protect access to clean water: Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. If necessary for public health, suspend mining activities until the source of emissions has been addressed. In an April 2017 memorandum addressed to the Guinean government, local officials, religious leaders, civil society activists and youth leaders from Boké described the factors motivating resentment toward the government and mining companies. Once mining begins, environment ministry officials said that they can in theory refuse to renew a company's environmental certificate, required to operate in Guinea, where deficiencies are identified. In CBG's case, for example, local officials and community leaders said that for decades the company never paid compensation for land used for mining . When asked about the social, environmental, and human rights consequences of mining , the Guinean government and mining companies often state that mining has generated thousands of jobs in the Boké region and highlight the considerable money and time that they invest in community development projects, from building or refurbishing local schools to partnerships with local women's cooperatives. Although the government can in principle fine companies in breach of environmental obligations, national and local officials said that they believe that the contribution of mining to the Guinean economy protects companies from government sanctions. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UN CESCR), the committee of experts that monitors the implementation of the ICESCR, has stated that this requires states to take measures to prevent pollution by third parties, such as mining companies. ""I don't think humans can coexist with the mine,"" said a health worker who serves villages where SMB operates . In areas where the SMB consortium operates , we conducted research in communities around the consortium's ports at Dapilon and Katougouma, its mines at Kaboe and Malapouya and along the mining roads linking Katougouma port to the Kaboe and Dabis mines and Dapilon port to the Malapouya network of mines. : Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. Click to expand Image Farmers from Hamdallaye village, in the Boké region, look out over the village's ancestral lands, which have been cleared by La Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée for an expansion of mining operations .

While mining has brought thousands of jobs to the Boké region, residents of rural villages said that jobs in the mining sector cannot offset the food and income that the community previously derived from land. A water balance for mining operations, describing how mining will occur without altering local water levels and quality. But this does not offset a failure to respect human rights throughout their operations ."" As well as monitoring the impact of individual mining projects, monitor and publicly report on the cumulative impacts of mining on the environment and livelihoods, including impacts exacerbated by climate change. ""I think criticizing SMB has become taboo inside the government,"" said a senior mining ministry official. Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. This legal advice should discuss: the government and mining companies' obligations during the ESIA process; how communities can provide input into the ESIA process, as well as how communities can challenge the arrival of mining operations in their locality; the steps that communities or individuals with customary land tenure can take to protect their property rights. : Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. The production mining by the Chinese companies has already been started as repayment of the loan. Doctors and health workers who spoke to Human Rights Watch said that, given the absence of public air quality monitoring data by mining companies and the lack of reliable local government health statistics, it is impossible to draw firm conclusions on potential associations between mining and respiratory illnesses. The Guinean government conducts only a very limited number of air quality measurements for each company each year, but in some cases, particularly in SMB's concession, the monitoring suggests at worst a potentially serious risk to public health and at best an urgent need for improved monitoring by mining companies and the government. Miners now have little other option than to sit tight and await further clarity from the transitional authorities."" A failure to do so could mean that, far from being part of the solution to Guinea's drive for development, mining remains a major threat to communities' livelihoods and way of life. A water balance for mining operations , describing how mining will occur without altering local water levels and quality. In view of the distinctive impact of mining on women, and the barriers they face in airing grievances, companies should consult regularly with women and ensure that remedies include specific solutions for women. Monitor and protect access to clean water: Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Almost everyone in the village had a plot there,"" said a farmer from Hamdallaye, describing land that CBG expropriated for mining in 2015. Guinea's National Assembly has commissions on mining and on natural resources that should provide oversight of the government's regulation of the mining sector, including through field visits to mining facilities. Conduct independent monitoring: Commission independent monitors, paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors . Improve monitoring of mining companies : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( Bureau Guinéen d'Etudes et d'Evaluation Environnementale (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations. In 2009, as part of a directive designed to harmonize standards regulating mining in West Africa, the West African regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), declared that states and mining companies have an ""obligation to respect and promote recognized human rights including the rights of women, children and workers arising from mining activities."" We knew already broadly what the impacts of mining would be."" Once mining begins, the BGEEE also conducts annual inspections of mining companies, which help the environment ministry to decide whether to reissue each year a company's Certificate of Environmental Conformity, which is, in theory, required for the company to continue operating each year. How Guinea's Bauxite Boom Affects Human Rights  Although Guinea's bauxite boom provides much-needed tax revenue for the government, thousands of jobs, and profits to mining companies and their shareholders, it has profound human rights consequences for the rural communities that live closest to mining operations . The mining code states that the arrival of a mining project does not extinguish property rights and that, ""no right to prospect or operate is valid without the consent of the individual with property rights or his or her successors, with regard to activities involving the surface or affecting it. Partner with international public health experts to improve the BGEEE's capacity to conduct air quality monitoring, including by improving the equipment used for monitoring and significantly increasing the frequency of monitoring . Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. But the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that exposure to any fine particle dust, which makes up a portion of the dust produced by mining activities , can cause, trigger or exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Monitor and protect air quality: Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. These texts, which should be developed in consultation with civil society and affected communities, should: Monitor and protect access to clean water: Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. When asked about the social, environmental, and human rights consequences of mining, the Guinean government and mining companies often state that mining has generated thousands of jobs in the Boké region and highlight the considerable money and time that they invest in community development projects, from building or refurbishing local schools to partnerships with local women's cooperatives. These practices are facilitated by the inadequate protections afforded by Guinean law to customary land tenure rights, particularly in rural areas, where mining has the biggest impact. The optimism for the arrival of democracy in Guinea translated into a few years of sustained economic growth with percentages of up to 7% per year thanks to a better business climate and the diversification of foreign investment. ""But since they arrived in Libya I've not had any news for about two months. In SMB's case, the government took shortcuts during the approval process for new projects to ensure mining started quickly, prioritizing investment over a comprehensive analysis of social and environmental risks. These efforts, however, while commendable, do not relieve mining companies of their responsibility to exercise due diligence to prevent mining operations -the core of their business-from infringing on the rights of local communities, and to provide redress where damage is caused. As well as monitoring the impact of individual mining projects, monitor and publicly report on the cumulative impacts of mining on the environment and livelihoods, including impacts exacerbated by climate change. Satellite imagery reviewed by Human Rights Watch shows the land that CBG has expropriated for mining . : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining , fair compensation is paid, including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. : Draft and adopt regulations describing the process to be followed to resettle and compensate communities who lose land to mining , whether homes or agricultural land.

Communities in the Boké region also told Human Rights Watch that the expropriation of land for mining or mining infrastructure had prevented communities from accessing streams and natural springs where they previously found water, while an influx of people seeking jobs in mines increased pressure on remaining water resources. Boké: The Explosive Center of Guinea's Bauxite Industry  Bauxite mining has made the Boké region, which is in lower Guinea (La Basse Guinée), along the country's western coast and bordering Guinea Bissau, the center of Guinea's mining-driven economic growth. While a development-focused government might want to attract investment into the sector, it should also fine, suspend or stop mining projects where companies egregiously or persistently flout the environmental, social and human protections enshrined in Guinean law. The absence of public government or company data regarding the impact of mining on water levels and quality, however, makes it difficult to assess the adequacy of companies' responses. We took measures to ensure that our investigations accurately reflected women's distinctive experiences with mining . Human Rights Watch also met local mining , environment and agriculture officials in Boké and Sangaredi.

SMB has paid villages a bonus-in the form of rice and other supplies given to community leaders-if they do not disrupt mining activities over a three-month period. Several community leaders said that in the absence of constructive ways to resolve grievances, they had no option but to stage demonstrations to disrupt mining activities to force companies and the government to listen to their concerns.

Although the mining code was first enacted in 2011, the Guinean government has not yet passed these implementing regulations. Mitigation measures that should be implemented immediately include paving mining roads passing close to towns, villages or other inhabited areas.

Although women are acutely impacted by loss of land to mining, reduced access to water, and concerns over health, strong social norms that discourage women from equal participation in village governance mean that women face barriers in lodging complaints. Communities remain concerned, however, about the impact on air quality of both exhaust emissions and dust, even if dust levels have somewhat reduced . Reduced Access to Water  Unless managed appropriately, studies show that bauxite mining will have significant impacts on the hydrology of the surrounding landscape. Community leaders said that mining companies rarely accept that they are responsible for the reduced productivity of agricultural land or reduced income from fishing and only occasionally provide compensation. Community leaders said that mining companies rarely accept that they are responsible for the reduced productivity of agricultural land or reduced income from fishing and only occasionally provide compensation. Damage to water sources that residents attribute to mining, as well as increased demand due to population migration to mining sites, reduces communities' access to water for drinking, washing and cooking. In coordination with the Guinean health ministry, assess whether adequate health services are in place to address the health impacts of reduced air quality, especially for children and older people.

Many are worried, however, that reduced air quality from mining activities could contribute to negative health outcomes. Threats to Health from Reduced Air Quality  Scores of residents from the Boké region described how their lives had been blighted by the dust produced by the mining and transport of bauxite, with red dust entering villages and homes and covering crops. The dust produced by bauxite mining and transport smothers fields and enters homes, leaving families and health workers worried that reduced air quality threatens their health and environment.

But the government's focus on growing the bauxite sector has at times appeared to take priority over social and environmental protections. [13] This meant that, when added to a slump in the global price of bauxite, Guinea's bauxite sector barely grew during Condé's first term, with production marginally increasing from 17.6 million tons in 2011 to 18 million in 2015. [14]  The Bauxite Boom  Guinea's bauxite sector has grown rapidly since 2015. The government's efforts to grow the mining sector during Condé first term, however, encountered obstacles. The memorandum referenced a lack of drinking water and electricity in Boké, and referred to the impact of mining on health, livelihoods and the environment, decrying ""the destruction of forests, biodiversity, grazing fields and agricultural land from clearing and exploitation by mining…the pollution of the environment which affects the health of the population…the inadequacy of social structures in view of the growing population,"" and ""the systematic exclusion of affected populations from the financial benefits of mining exploitation.""",A0_pag_causer_of_growth_-_should_be_possible,CBG,A1_ppt_thing_grown,the bauxite sector,A2_ext_amount_increased_by,list of projects

""But we lost land to the mine and last year we couldn't farm much of what we have left because the dust makes trees unproductive."" Although women are acutely impacted by loss of land to mining, reduced access to water, and concerns over health, strong social norms that discourage women from equal participation in village governance mean that women face barriers in lodging complaints. Human Rights Watch visited four villages around Sangaredi-Hamdallaye, Boundou Waadé, Danta Fonye and Kogon Lengue-where community leaders said they had lost significant portions of their ancestral lands to mining; two more recent settlements, Kankalaré I and II, that CBG relocated in 2017 and early 2018; and three other villages, Parawol, Fassaly Foutabé and M'Bororé, who stand to lose land as CBG's operations expand.

Mining has long been a major contributor to the Guinean economy, with mining revenues making up almost 20 percent of Guinea's gross domestic product and almost 90 percent of its exports in 2014. All of SMB's bauxite is exported to China, where it is purchased by China Hongqiao Group, a member of the SMB consortium.

Bauxite from Guinea is exported to refineries across the world, including in China, North America, and Europe, where it is refined into aluminum for use in car and airplane parts and consumer products like beverage cans and tin foil. Development of vast iron ore deposits in Guinea's southeast region have long been undermined by corruption allegations, as well as the enormous costs of exporting the ore from an area more than 700 kilometers from Guinea's coast. Since it began exporting bauxite in 1973, CBG has progressively excavated and mined large tracts of land surrounding the town of Sangaredi, where its mining operations are concentrated, moving between different pits to find the necessary quality of bauxite to meet suppliers' demands. The demand for Guinean bauxite in global markets has increased in recent years as other countries, notably Indonesia in 2014 and Malaysia in 2016, have banned exports . These projects were chosen because they were the two biggest exporters of bauxite in Guinea in 2017. customers recently placed heavier emphasis on importing calcined (processed) rather than crude bauxite, resulting in a significant drop in Guinea's bauxite exports to the United States. Guinea holds 35 percent of the world's bauxite reserves (10-40 billion tons) and becomes the second main bauxite exporter after Australia since 2019, according to the October 2020 World Bank Group report on Commodity Markets Outlook. Thus, in 2016 CBG began shipping most of its product to China instead of the United States, exporting less than two to the United States by 2017.",A0_pag_exporter,CBG,A1_ppt_product,bauxite,A2_gol_importer,CBG

Only approve proposed extractive industries projects where applicants' have adequately assessed human rights, social and environmental risks and demonstrated their ability to protect communities from negative impacts. Indeed, despite deficiencies with the environmental and social impact assessments first submitted by SMB, the government allowed the project to rapidly move forward, leading to tangible environmental and social consequences for communities. Redo impact assessments that did not involve effective consultation with local communities or which did not adequately assess or propose mitigation for the environmental and social consequences of mining. Require that affected communities have access to independent legal advice when environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) are conducted by companies and reviewed by the Guinean government. Once an ESIA is submitted to the Guinean government, it is assessed by a 23-person inter-ministerial committee, which includes representatives of civil society organizations. To enable civil society organizations to supplement government oversight, the government should ensure greater transparency in the sector, including by requiring publication of environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs), environmental and social management plans (ESMPs), government and company periodic monitoring reports, and public data-from both companies and the government-on the health and environmental impacts of mining. To Mining Companies  Address weaknesses in past ESIAs: Redo impact assessments that did not involve effective consultation with local communities or which did not adequately assess or propose mitigation for the environmental and social consequences of mining.

prestation," Regulatory Framework  National Law  Although neither Guinea's 2011 mining code nor its 1989 environment code explicitly mention human rights, they both impose obligations on companies to avoid or remedy the negative social and environmental impacts of mining. Although the Guinean government bears the primary responsibility for protecting communities, companies also have an obligation to ensure that their activities do not result in negative environmental, social and human rights impacts. In 2009, as part of a directive designed to harmonize standards regulating mining in West Africa, the West African regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), declared that states and mining companies have an "" obligation to respect and promote recognized human rights including the rights of women, children and workers arising from mining activities.""

Finally, they should ensure that their staff are adequately resourced and trained to effectively monitor the impacts of mining and establish effective grievance mechanisms to remedy adverse consequences. This means that they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved."" A lack of transparency from mining companies and the Guinean government regarding the social and environmental impacts of mining compounds the absence of effective state oversight. They say they take steps to mitigate the impact of mining on local water sources and highlight their work to build boreholes and wells in mining-affected communities. Loss of Land and Livelihoods  Dozens of farmers from 16 villages located near mines, ports and mining roads described how mining companies have expropriated ancestral farmlands without adequately addressing the impact on farmers' ability to support and feed their families. These practices are facilitated by the inadequate protections afforded by Guinean law to customary land tenure rights, particularly in rural areas, where mining has the biggest impact . Improve monitoring of mining companies : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( Bureau Guinéen d'Etudes et d'Evaluation Environnementale (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations.

Conduct independent monitoring: Commission independent monitors, paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors.

Commission independent monitors, paid for by the company but operating as a separate entity, to periodically (every six months) evaluate the environmental, social and human rights impact of mining operations and publish periodic reports by those monitors. Residents who stand to lose land as CBG's operations expand expressed fears of the impact on their own livelihoods. The protests demonstrated deep-rooted anger driven by a perception that Boké residents had not only insufficiently benefited from mining but also endured the negative impact of mining on people's livelihoods, health and environment. Respect rural land rights : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining, fair compensation is paid, including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. Require that affected communities have access to independent legal advice when environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) are conducted by companies and reviewed by the Guinean government. The memorandum referenced a lack of drinking water and electricity in Boké, and referred to the impact of mining on health, livelihoods and the environment, decrying ""the destruction of forests, biodiversity, grazing fields and agricultural land from clearing and exploitation by mining…the pollution of the environment which affects the health of the population…the inadequacy of social structures in view of the growing population,"" and ""the systematic exclusion of affected populations from the financial benefits of mining exploitation."" A stream crossing plan describing how, where mining infrastructure crosses rivers or streams, the impact on water levels and quality will be minimized. Riots broke out in Boké in April and September 2017, due to anger at inadequate local services, particularly a lack of water and electricity, resentment at the rapid expansion of mining and broader concerns about the impacts of mining on local communities. Initiate a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the environmental, social and human rights impact of bauxite mining in the Boké region. Ensure that existing community relations teams and health, safety and environment staff are adequately staffed, resourced and trained to effectively monitor the environmental, social and human rights impacts of mining.

In the absence of clear protection for customary land rights, mining companies often maintain that rural land remains, in legal terms, ""the property of the state,"" which has granted the company the right to exploit it. Ensure there is a legal mechanism to protect such land rights. While a development-focused government might want to attract investment into the sector, it should also fine, suspend or stop mining projects where companies egregiously or persistently flout the environmental, social and human protections enshrined in Guinean law. Monitor and protect access to clean water: Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. International Human Rights Standards  The Guinean government has an obligation under human rights law to protect and secure human rights against abuses by businesses, such as mining companies, including through the enforcement of laws requiring companies to respect human rights. The code requires that ESIAs be conducted, ""in accordance with the environment code and its implementing regulations, as well as internationally-accepted standards,"" and that, ""appropriate techniques and methods must be used to protect the environment and the safety of workers and the local community in accordance with the environment code or international best practices in this area."" Although the government can in principle fine companies in breach of environmental obligations, national and local officials said that they believe that the contribution of mining to the Guinean economy protects companies from government sanctions. For example, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) protects the right to healthy natural environments as part of the right to health. Implement land reform to protect customary land rights : As part of a wider land reform process, urgently take action to identify, secure and demarcate customary land rights, particularly in areas where mining exploitation is planned. Only approve ESIAs and environmental and social management plans (ESMP) if they contain adequate measures to protect natural water resources and/or to provide communities with alternatives water sources. The land law's ambiguous protection of customary rights would be less problematic if the Guinean government had established regulations setting out uniform standards for resettlements and land acquisitions in the mining sector, which could set out more clearly the compensation owed to anyone occupying land or holding customary land tenure rights. Government authorities should not only make the information accessible upon request, but also proactively disseminate information that is relevant to the protection of rights of affected communities. Mining companies take advantage of the ambiguous protection for rural land rights in Guinean law to expropriate ancestral farmlands without adequate compensation or for financial payments that cannot replace the benefits communities derived from land. Guinea's 2011 mining code requires companies to, ""ensure the rational exploitation of mineral resources in harmony with the protection of the environment and the preservation of health,"" as well as work for the ""promotion or maintenance of the living conditions and general good health of the population. Guinean law does not currently require companies to provide communities who lose land with livelihood assistance to maintain or improve their income and living standards, threatening community members' rights to food and to development, protected under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. ""We wanted mining activities to begin first, while there was a lack of supply [from other countries] in the market, while at least ensuring the minimum legal rights were protected from the beginning,"" said Saadou Nimaga, secretary general of the ministry of mines. These texts, which should be developed in consultation with civil society and affected communities, should: Monitor and protect access to clean water: Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. ""We're aiming to integrate environmental and social protections gradually."" ""The government of Nigeria strongly condemns and rejects any unconstitutional change of government and therefore calls on those behind the coup to restore constitutional order without delay and protect lives and property."" Ensure there is a legal mechanism to protect such land rights. What Needs to Be Done  As Guinea's bauxite boom continues, it is imperative that the government's capacity to oversee the mining sector and protect the rights of community members keeps pace. Inadequate Protection of Customary Land Rights in Guinea  Guinea's 1992 property law can arguably be interpreted to recognize customary rights under a provision that says that property owners include occupants of land who can demonstrate ""peaceful, personal, and continuous occupancy in good faith."" At the root of CBG's past failure to adequately compensate and restitute land was the company's embrace of the lack of clear protection given to customary land rights under Guinean law. The Guinean government has, since the passage of the 2011 mining code, failed to pass regulations establishing compensation standards for land acquisitions in the mining sector-a missed opportunity to provide clearer protection to rural farmers and communities. Although the Guinean government bears the primary responsibility for protecting communities, companies also have an obligation to ensure that their activities do not result in negative environmental, social and human rights impacts. Since the passage of a 2011 mining code, the government has also failed to pass regulations establishing compensation standards for land acquisitions in the mining sector-a missed opportunity to provide clearer protection for the land rights of rural farmers and communities. Human Rights Protections for Customary Land Rights  Rural land in Guinea is typically organized by reference to customary (i.e. This legal advice should discuss: the government and mining companies' obligations during the ESIA process; how communities can provide input into the ESIA process, as well as how communities can challenge the arrival of mining operations in their locality; the steps that communities or individuals with customary land tenure can take to protect their property rights. For individuals or communities with legally-recognizable property rights, Guinean laws do on paper provide some protection from interference with these rights by mining companies. In practice, however, obtaining legal protection requires communities or individuals with customary land tenure to have formally registered their land tenure rights or recorded them in local land maps. International and African human rights instruments protect individuals and communities, including those with customary land tenure, from arbitrary interference with their rights to property and land. These guidelines, consistent with the ambiguous protection of customary rights in Guinea's land law, seem to assume that mining companies are only required to pay farmers for the value of trees and crops growing on land.This policy is so outdated, however, that companies set their own compensation frameworks, giving them significant discretion as to how much to pay and for what. These texts, which should be developed in consultation with civil society and affected communities, should: Monitor and protect access to clean water: Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. All ESIAs and ESMPs should include: Monitor and protect air quality: Monitor air quality in residential areas affected by mining, publish the monitoring results and publicly explain potential public health impacts. But the government's focus on growing the bauxite sector has at times appeared to take priority over social and environmental protections . Although Guinea's land law can be interpreted to recognize customary rights, obtaining legal protection in practice requires communities or individuals with customary land tenure to have formally registered or recorded their landownership. Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. If necessary for public health or to protect access to water, suspend mining activities until the problem has been addressed. Guinea has ratified several United Nations and African human rights treaties that protect rights applicable to the issues discussed in this report. Only approve proposed extractive industries projects where applicants' have adequately assessed human rights, social and environmental risks and demonstrated their ability to protect communities from negative impacts. Recommendations  To the Government of Guinea  Strengthen the approval process for new mining projects: Only approve proposed extractive industries projects where applicants' have adequately assessed human rights, social and environmental risks and demonstrated their ability to protect communities from negative impacts. Very few rural farmers have done this-in large part due to the government's failure to roll out a 2001 rural land policy intended to facilitate land demarcation, registration and protection in rural areas.

Access to Remedies  Community leaders told Human Rights Watch that mining companies often do not promptly or meaningfully respond to their complaints about the impacts of bauxite mining on their land, livelihoods, health and water sources. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. Government authorities should not only make the information accessible upon request, but also proactively disseminate information that is relevant to the protection of rights of affected communities. Improve transparency: Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining. Damage to water sources that residents attribute to mining, as well as increased demand due to population migration to mining sites, reduces communities' access to water for drinking, washing and cooking. NRGI defined it, ""a natural resource-backed loan is a mechanism by which a country can access funds in exchange for future flows of income from its natural resources, such as oil or minerals, or in exchange for repayment guarantees made up of these resources"". These texts, which should be developed in consultation with civil society and affected communities, should: Monitor and protect access to clean water: Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Require that affected communities have access to independent legal advice when environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) are conducted by companies and reviewed by the Guinean government. Communities in the Boké region also told Human Rights Watch that the expropriation of land for mining or mining infrastructure had prevented communities from accessing streams and natural springs where they previously found water, while an influx of people seeking jobs in mines increased pressure on remaining water resources. Monitor the effectiveness of companies' measures to protect access to water, including by monitoring water levels and quality, making public monitoring data, and explaining any potential health impacts. Although women are acutely impacted by loss of land to mining, reduced access to water, and concerns over health, strong social norms that discourage women from equal participation in village governance mean that women face barriers in lodging complaints. If necessary for public health or to protect access to water, suspend mining activities until the problem has been addressed. Reduced Access to Water  Unless managed appropriately, studies show that bauxite mining will have significant impacts on the hydrology of the surrounding landscape. Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining. Monitor and protect access to clean water: Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. Mining companies underscore that there are multiple reasons for inadequate access to water in the Boké region, including population migration, climate change-related factors and the aridity of the area, particularly in the dry season.

compensation," Ensure companies take steps to improve households' social and economic rights until they exceed pre-mining levels. ""CBG only really started paying compensation in 2015,"" said Nestor Fara Leone, the head of the local government's rural development service in Sangaredi. Although women participate in farming, the bulk of compensation for land belonging to families or communities is paid to men in family or community leadership roles. Where compensation was paid, however, CBG often utilized outdated compensation standards, which severely undervalued farmers' crops, and did not adequately compensate farmers for the value of the land itself, making it harder for farmers to find replacement land or to develop new revenue streams. The dissenting military official were believed to have staged the coup on the heels of a move by the parliament to increase the salaries of politicians while slashing the budget for security forces. : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining, fair compensation is paid, including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. A lack of transparency from mining companies and the Guinean government regarding the social and environmental impacts of mining compounds the absence of effective state oversight. In a video message addressed to the nation through social networks, Doumbouya himself has announced the suspension of the Constitution, the dissolution of the institutions and the Government, and the closure of land and air borders. Where compensation was paid, however, CBG often utilized outdated compensation standards, which severely undervalued farmers' crops, and did not adequately compensate farmers for the value of the land itself, making it harder for farmers to find replacement land or to develop new revenue streams. Potential sanctions should include meaningful financial penalties, temporary suspension of activities for a defined period and, ultimately, the project's termination. [8] His government in 2011 promulgated a new mining code, which was already in development when he came into office, envisioned to give the Guinean government a greater share of mining revenue and improve governance of the mining sector, including by increasing the transparency of the process through which mining titles are awarded. What Needs to Be Done  As Guinea's bauxite boom continues, it is imperative that the government's capacity to oversee the mining sector and protect the rights of community members keeps pace. Require that affected communities have access to independent legal advice when environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) are conducted by companies and reviewed by the Guinean government . At the root of CBG's past failure to adequately compensate and restitute land was the company's embrace of the lack of clear protection given to customary land rights under Guinean law. The military officials later said they had taken control of the French speaking West African country in an apparent coup . Provide safeguards to ensure that women can participate in compensation processes and receive adequate compensation, replacement land and/or livelihood assistance. Loss of Land and Livelihoods  Dozens of farmers from 16 villages located near mines, ports and mining roads described how mining companies have expropriated ancestral farmlands without adequate compensation or in exchange for financial payments that don't replace the benefits families and communities derived from land. Earlier, the Guinean media reported that the country's President Alpha Conde was arrested by military special forces who rebelled against him. Ensure that individuals with customary land tenure, and occupants of land who have planted crops or built infrastructure on land, are adequately compensated where land is acquired for mining and that their living standards are not negatively impacted. In an April 2017 memorandum addressed to the Guinean government, local officials, religious leaders, civil society activists and youth leaders from Boké described the factors motivating resentment toward the government and mining companies. Very few rural farmers have done this-in large part due to the government 's failure to roll out a 2001 rural land policy intended to facilitate land demarcation, registration and protection in rural areas. Establish effective grievance mechanisms so that individuals affected by mining projects can complain directly to companies in addition to the government . Partner with international public health experts to improve the BGEEE's capacity to conduct air quality monitoring, including by improving the equipment used for monitoring and significantly increasing the frequency of monitoring. "" Compensation just comes in one go, whereas your crops and fields stay with you for many years, for decades even,"" said one farmer. Prior to obtaining government approval for a mining project, the 2011 mining code requires mining companies to submit an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) that examines the likely consequences of mining on local communities. In a video message addressed to the nation through social networks, Doumbouya himself has announced the suspension of the Constitution, the dissolution of the institutions and the Government, and the closure of land and air borders. Analysts expressed worry that the coup had created a power vacuum, with likely disruption for the country's lucrative mining sector, which had seen protests in recent months, which authorities clamped down on. The tumult in Guinea comes about three months after military officials in neighboring Mali carried out a second coup d'etat in less than a year. However, his attempt to function autonomously and without being accountable to the Administration distanced him from the Government, according to anonymous military sources. These guidelines, consistent with the ambiguous protection of customary rights in Guinea's land law, seem to assume that mining companies are only required to pay farmers for the value of trees and crops growing on land.This policy is so outdated, however, that companies set their own compensation frameworks, giving them significant discretion as to how much to pay and for what. While a development-focused government might want to attract investment into the sector, it should also fine, suspend or stop mining projects where companies egregiously or persistently flout the environmental, social and human protections enshrined in Guinean law. The Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), an independent non-profit organization dedicated towards improving countries' governance over their natural resources to promote sustainable and inclusive development, publicizes that ""Natural resource-backed loans are loans surrounded by secrecy"". CBG's Past Compensation Practices  Community leaders, farmers and even local officials told Human Rights Watch that, until approximately 2015, CBG expropriated land without compensation . Interviewees were not compensated . CBG said it paid compensation in most cases and showed Human Rights Watch documented examples of compensation payments. Operationalize Prefectural Committees for Environmental and Social Supervision (Comités Préfectoraux de Suivi Environnemental et Social (CPSES)) by providing the equipment and funding, from mining companies if appropriate, needed for CPSES members to conduct site visits every quarter to each company operating in their locality. 01:20 Guinea military unit stages coup, claims to have detained president - video  ""If the people are crushed by their elites, it is up to the army to give the people their freedom,"" he said. The company said it could not guarantee that compensation was paid in all cases, but showed Human Rights Watch documentation indicating the compensation paid for several historical land acquisitions, from 2003 to 2014. He also announced the closure of the borders, the dissolution of the government and parliament, and the suspension of the constitution. Guinea's constitution states that land can only be expropriated in the public interest and with payment of fair compensation in advance. Although women participate in farming, the bulk of compensation for communal or familial land is often paid to men considered household heads. ""[91] Where a mining company cannot obtain consent, the mining code does give the state the right to require mining to occur, but only after adequate compensation is paid . Where land is acquired for mining, work with clients to ensure that fair compensation is paid to individuals with legal and customary land tenure, including for the value of land. Since its independence from France in 1958, it has known a succession of dictatorships and coups that seemed to come to an end with the rise to power of the historic and veteran opposition leader Alpha Condé in his first free elections, held in 2010. In 2011, he survived an assassination attempt when mutinous soldiers fired at the palace. The company said it could not guarantee that compensation was paid in all cases, but showed Human Rights Watch documentation indicating the compensation paid for several historical land acquisitions, from 2003 to 2014. 5 that they have dissolved the constitution and the government in the West African state. After having arrested the president, who is with us right now, we have decided to dissolve the Constitution in force, dissolve the institutions and the Government and close the land and air borders,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Doumbouya in a video recorded in a place unknown and distributed to the media this Sunday morning. CBG's 2017 compensation matrix provided for a payment of 1,319,819 GF ($127) for a fully-matured mango tree. However, the defence ministry said an attack on the presidential palace by mutinous forces had been put down. The code states that the amount of compensation owing is, ""determined as for expropriation,"" which suggests that companies may be required to follow the same legal mechanism through which land can be expropriated in the public interest, a process that is in principle overseen by the judiciary. A group of soldiers led by Lieutenant Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, head of the Guinea-Conakry Special Forces, staged a coup in this African country this Sunday and arrested and transferred the country's president, Alpha Condé, to an unknown location. CBG staff said the company did pay compensation for many of the land acquisitions that occurred before 2015. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. Land that men and women depended on and exploited is therefore replaced by financial compensation distributed only to a handful of largely male community leaders. This interpretation allows companies to acquire land without the informed consent of rural farmers or without providing adequate compensation . Community leaders said that too few villagers are employed by mining companies and, in any case, the pay that individual employees receive doesn't offset the benefit that entire households, families or communities derived from land. International Human Rights Standards  The Guinean government has an obligation under human rights law to protect and secure human rights against abuses by businesses, such as mining companies, including through the enforcement of laws requiring companies to respect human rights. In an April 2017 memorandum addressed to the Guinean government , local officials, religious leaders, civil society activists and youth leaders from Boké described the factors motivating resentment toward the government and mining companies. INTERFAX.RU - The United States condemns the military coup in Guinea and calls on all parties to the conflict to renounce violence, the State Department says. Strengthen the capacity of staff to oversee currently-neglected impacts of mining, such as the consequences of resettlement and land expropriations. Potential sanctions should include meaningful financial penalties, temporary suspension of activities for a defined period and, ultimately, the project's termination. Publish a policy paper describing the government 's approach to sanctioning mining companies and the circumstances in which each form of sanction will be imposed. : Draft and adopt regulations describing the process to be followed to resettle and compensate communities who lose land to mining, whether homes or agricultural land. Although women participate in farming, the bulk of compensation for communal or familial land is often paid to men considered household heads. The Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), an independent non-profit organization dedicated towards improving countries' governance over their natural resources to promote sustainable and inclusive development, publicizes that ""Natural resource-backed loans are loans surrounded by secrecy"". After having arrested the president, who is with us right now, we have decided to dissolve the Constitution in force, dissolve the institutions and the Government and close the land and air borders,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Doumbouya in a video recorded in a place unknown and distributed to the media this Sunday morning. ""The Nigerian government is saddened by the apparent coup d'etat that has taken place in the Republic of Guinea today, in clear violation of the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance ,"" the ministry said in a statement. Although women are acutely impacted by loss of land to mining, reduced access to water, and concerns over health, strong social norms that discourage women from equal participation in village governance mean that women face barriers in lodging complaints. Although the Guinean government bears the primary responsibility for protecting communities, companies also have an obligation to ensure that their activities do not result in negative environmental, social and human rights impacts. Where government or company monitoring suggests that levels of particulate matter or other emissions exceed the World Health Organizations' recommended levels, ensure companies take immediate steps to address the source of the emissions. The published footage shows how people who were hiding earlier greet the military, who detained the president in his palace, with joyful cries. Companies have in the past instead only acknowledged their responsibility to compensate the occupants of land for the crops and trees they have grown upon it, not-as required by human rights law-for the value of lost land and potential future loss of earnings. : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations. Special forces soldiers appeared on Sunday to have ousted Guinea's long-serving president, telling the nation they had dissolved its government and constitution and closed its land and air borders. Dejected, the leader looks at the camera and does not respond to the questions and comments of his captors, in a sequence that is very reminiscent of the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo in the Ivory Coast in 2011. Videos shared on social media showed Guinea's President Alpha Conde being detained by army special forces on Sunday. Dejected, the leader looks at the camera and does not respond to the questions and comments of his captors, in a sequence that is very reminiscent of the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo in the Ivory Coast in 2011. Heavy gunfire rang out in the centre of the Guinean capital Conkary on Sunday and troops were seen on the streets, amid reports of an attempted coup. ""I think criticizing SMB has become taboo inside the government ,"" said a senior mining ministry official. Land that men and women depended on and exploited is therefore replaced by financial compensation distributed only to a handful of largely male community leaders. news, latest-news  Soldiers who have staged an uprising in Guinea's capital have said in a short broadcast on state television that they have dissolved the constitution and the government in the West African country. The coup leader and head of the country's special forces, Col Mamadi Doumbouya, announced in state broadcasts on Sunday that the country's constitution had been suspended, the government dissolved and the borders closed, with a 24-hour curfew imposed. ""Each company has their own method for calculating compensation ,"" said Nestor Fara Leone, the head of the Rural Development Service in Sangaredi, which supervises companies' compensation payments during land acquisitions. In CBG's case, for example, local officials and community leaders said that for decades the company never paid compensation for land used for mining. Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining. Although the financial compensation mining companies do pay -at times to the entire community, at times to individual farmers-can be a short-term windfall, it is difficult for subsistence farmers to use the money to develop sustainable sources of income in the longer term. Mining executives said that individuals often refuse to accept alternatives to financial compensation but acknowledge the need for mining companies to combine financial payments with other forms of support, including training on how to manage compensation payments and assistance developing new sources of food and income. So far, he has made a number of statements that talk about the dissolution of the government, the closure of the country's borders and the abolition of the constitution during the transition period. Although oversight by both the mining and environment ministries is led by officials in Conakry, both ministries have representatives at the prefectural level, in local government offices in the city of Boké, and in certain subprefectures, including in Sangaredi, where CBG's mines are located. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. This report, based on more than 300 interviews in more than 30 mining-affected villages in the Boké region, as well as dozens of interviews with local and national government officials, civil society groups, environmental scientists, public health officials and company representatives, documents how the practices of mining companies, when combined with inadequate government oversight , upend the lives and livelihoods of rural communities. Guinea's president, Alpha Condé, is being held in military detention , according to an elite unit of the army who have led a coup condemned by the international community but welcomed by many in Guinea. If the provision of replacement land is not possible, require companies to provide both financial compensation for the value of land and property and livelihood assistance to restore or improve communities' living standards. The UN Basic Principles on Evictions state that, irrespective of whether people hold title to property, they are entitled to compensation for lost land as well as for material damage and loss of earnings. Heavy gunfire rang out in the centre of the Guinean capital Conkary on Sunday and troops were seen on the streets, amid reports of an attempted coup . Guinea's constitution states that land can only be expropriated in the public interest and with payment of fair compensation in advance. Videos appeared on social networks with joyful residents of the capital of Guinea, who ran out into the streets and joyfully greeted the military participating in the coup . Guinea's main opposition leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, denied rumors that he was among those detained . US State Department urges parties to conflict in Guinea to renounce violence  Moscow. In one case documented by Human Rights Watch, a farmer who received compensation in 2003 was paid according to the valuation set in the 1987 compensation matrix. Respect rural land rights : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining, fair compensation is paid, including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. Develop an approach for addressing historical land acquisitions that did not respect Guinean law or international human rights law, including through land rehabilitation programs and other forms of compensation . CBG said it paid compensation in most cases and showed Human Rights Watch documented examples of compensation payments. ""The Nigerian government is saddened by the apparent coup d'etat that has taken place in the Republic of Guinea today, in clear violation of the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""You can use compensation to improve your house, but now that your farmland has gone you still have to put food on the table."" Government Oversight The capacity and resources of the government agencies that oversee the mining industry have improved in recent years, due in part to training and equipment from international donors. The Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests is the agency primarily responsible for overseeing companies' compliance with Guinea's environmental laws. ""We have dissolved government and institutions,"" Doumbouya — a former French foreign legionnaire — said on state television, draped in Guinea's national flag and surrounded by eight other armed soldiers. Pay special attention to impacts of land acquisitions on women, and ensure they are appropriately compensated for their losses. Guinea's National Assembly has commissions on mining and on natural resources that should provide oversight of the government's regulation of the mining sector, including through field visits to mining facilities. The Guinean government has, since the passage of the 2011 mining code, failed to pass regulations establishing compensation standards for land acquisitions in the mining sector-a missed opportunity to provide clearer protection to rural farmers and communities. Provide safeguards to ensure that women can participate in compensation processes and receive adequate compensation , replacement land and/or livelihood assistance. ""The government of Nigeria strongly condemns and rejects any unconstitutional change of government and therefore calls on those behind the coup to restore constitutional order without delay and protect lives and property."" Second, limiting compensation payments to plants and crops also meant that farmers received no compensation for land that, although currently lying fallow, is a key part of their village's crop rotation system. If necessary for public health or to protect access to water, suspend mining activities until the problem has been addressed. Improve transparency: Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining. The government, with support from international donors, should also strengthen national and local-level government institutions to enable them to provide effective and more regular supervision of mining companies. These guidelines, consistent with the ambiguous protection of customary rights in Guinea's land law, seem to assume that mining companies are only required to pay farmers for the value of trees and crops growing on land.This policy is so outdated, however, that companies set their own compensation frameworks, giving them significant discretion as to how much to pay and for what. Although the mining code was first enacted in 2011, the Guinean government has not yet passed these implementing regulations. Local government officials in Guinea include those nominated directly by the executive, whose role is to represent the central government at the regional level (through a governor), in prefectures (through prefects) and in subprefectures (through subprefects). When asked about the social, environmental, and human rights consequences of mining, the Guinean government and mining companies often state that mining has generated thousands of jobs in the Boké region and highlight the considerable money and time that they invest in community development projects, from building or refurbishing local schools to partnerships with local women's cooperatives. ""We asked the company to compensate us, but they refused. As things stand, civil society leaders said that, instead of reinvesting compensation money, farmers share it with family members, build new houses, or even send their children to Europe via the North Africa migration route. Although the mining code states that any lawful occupant of land should receive, ""compensation for the disturbance of enjoyment suffered,"" it does not provide further detail and states that, ""the amount, frequency, method of payments and other terms"" relating to compensation are to be determined in accordance with the mining code and further implementing regulations. To enable civil society organizations to supplement government oversight , the government should ensure greater transparency in the sector, including by requiring publication of environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs), environmental and social management plans (ESMPs), government and company periodic monitoring reports, and public data-from both companies and the government-on the health and environmental impacts of mining. Since 2015, the government of President Alpha Condé has transformed Guinea into a top global exporter, and the biggest to China, where the bulk of global aluminum is produced. In April 2018, we also sent the Guinean government a list of questions, and the government's response is annexed to this report. Methodology  This report documents how the practices of mining companies, when combined with inadequate government oversight , upend the lives and livelihoods of rural communities. If the provision of replacement land is not possible, require companies to provide both financial compensation for the value of land and property and livelihood assistance to restore or improve communities' living standards. After having arrested the president, who is with us right now, we have decided to dissolve the Constitution in force, dissolve the institutions and the Government and close the land and air borders,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Doumbouya in a video recorded in a place unknown and distributed to the media this Sunday morning. Guinea's government told Human Rights Watch that, in view of the potential human rights issues associated with mining, the government ""utilizes fully its state power to ensure Guinean laws [relating to the mining sector] are respected and to oversee the activities of mining companies."" ""We asked the company to compensate us, but they refused . The company said it could not guarantee that compensation was paid in all cases, but showed Human Rights Watch documentation indicating the compensation paid for several historical land acquisitions, from 2003 to 2014. Where government or company monitoring suggests mining is impacting access to clean water, ensure companies take immediate steps to address the cause. [8] His government in 2011 promulgated a new mining code, which was already in development when he came into office, envisioned to give the Guinean government a greater share of mining revenue and improve governance of the mining sector, including by increasing the transparency of the process through which mining titles are awarded. Because President Condé's ruling coalition, however, holds the majority of seats in parliament they are able to and have blocked proposed plenary debates in the Assembly or the formation of parliamentary commissions of inquiry to investigate allegations of misconduct by companies or inadequate government oversight . In 2011, he survived an assassination attempt when mutinous soldiers fired at the palace. ""Compensation just comes in one go, whereas your crops and fields stay with you for many years, for decades even,"" said one farmer. Mining companies take advantage of the ambiguous protection for rural land rights in Guinean law to expropriate ancestral farmlands without adequate compensation or for financial payments that cannot replace the benefits communities derived from land. INTERFAX.RU - The United States condemns the military coup in Guinea and calls on all parties to the conflict to renounce violence, the State Department says. The coup leader in Guinea, Mamady Dumbuya, confirmed reports of Konde's arrest by his supporters. If necessary for public health, suspend mining activities until the source of emissions has been addressed. Companies should provide replacement land or livelihood restoration assistance to households who lose land to mining, ensuring that any financial compensation is provided in a way that promotes economic self-sufficiency. A lack of transparency from mining companies and the Guinean government regarding the social and environmental impacts of mining compounds the absence of effective state oversight . The local representatives of both ministries are supposed to provide additional oversight of companies' activities and report periodically to their superiors in Conakry. A water supply plan, as required by the mining code, detailing the steps the company will take to maintain and improve water supply for local communities. Nevertheless, government institutions still have nowhere near the personnel, resources and, at times, political will to effectively oversee an ever-expanding list of projects, with the government's focus on growing the mining sector at times trumping environmental and social concerns. Government Oversight  The capacity and resources of the government agencies that oversee the mining industry have improved in recent years, due in part to training and equipment from international donors. CBG in 2018 committed to deploy a new approach to compensation , in which farmers will receive replacement land from rehabilitated mining sites. CBG staff said the company did pay compensation for many of the land acquisitions that occurred before 2015. They said that the company had paid compensation for the value of crops and trees growing on the land, with an additional 10 percent added to the valuation to reflect the cost to farmers of obtaining new land and 10 percent for the inconvenience suffered and for potential errors in valuation. Secretary General António Guterres condemned ""any takeover of the government by force of the gun."" Under the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement, states may, as a last resort, involuntarily remove occupants of land where evictions are, ""authorized by law,"" provide, ""full and fair compensation ,"" and do not result in a community's regression in the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to health, food and water. Although the compensation mining companies do pay -at times to the entire community, at times to individual farmers or families-can be a short-term windfall. Despite the creation of jobs, however, the influx of mining companies into the Boké region has caused resentment among the local population. The coup in Guinea comes barely three months after military officers seized power in neighbouring Mali, marking the second coup d'etat in less than a year. Videos appeared on social networks with joyful residents of the capital of Guinea, who ran out into the streets and joyfully greeted the military participating in the coup. The coup leader and head of the country's special forces, Col Mamadi Doumbouya, announced in state broadcasts on Sunday that the country's constitution had been suspended , the government dissolved and the borders closed, with a 24-hour curfew imposed. Develop regulations on land acquisitions in the mining sector : Draft and adopt regulations describing the process to be followed to resettle and compensate communities who lose land to mining, whether homes or agricultural land. The president's detention roused speculation that the army was angry after parliament moved to fatten the salaries of politicians last week while slashing the budget for security forces. ""CBG only really started paying compensation in 2015,"" said Nestor Fara Leone, the head of the local government 's rural development service in Sangaredi. © 2018 Ricci Shryock for Human Rights Watch  Even where applied, however, this approach to compensation had several problems. ""The government of Nigeria strongly condemns and rejects any unconstitutional change of government and therefore calls on those behind the coup to restore constitutional order without delay and protect lives and property."" ""I used the compensation money I got to send my two sons to Europe,"" a father told Human Rights Watch. CBG community relations staff told Human Rights Watch in October 2017 that CBG doesn't compensate fallow land. Although the mining code states that any lawful occupant of land should receive, "" compensation for the disturbance of enjoyment suffered,"" it does not provide further detail and states that, ""the amount, frequency, method of payments and other terms"" relating to compensation are to be determined in accordance with the mining code and further implementing regulations. The defence ministry said the attempted insurgency had been put down. Respect rural land rights : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining, fair compensation is paid , including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. ""Each company has their own method for calculating compensation,"" said Nestor Fara Leone, the head of the Rural Development Service in Sangaredi, which supervises companies' compensation payments during land acquisitions. Guinea's president, Alpha Condé, is being held in military detention, according to an elite unit of the army who have led a coup condemned by the international community but welcomed by many in Guinea. The company said it could not guarantee that compensation was paid in all cases, but showed Human Rights Watch documentation indicating the compensation paid for several historical land acquisitions, from 2003 to 2014. Land that men and women depended on and exploited is therefore replaced by financial compensation distributed only to a handful of largely male community leaders and household heads. Where compensation was paid , however, CBG often utilized outdated compensation standards, which severely undervalued farmers' crops, and did not adequately compensate farmers for the value of the land itself, making it harder for farmers to find replacement land or to develop new revenue streams. ""We call on our brothers in arms to unite to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the people of Guinea, we invite them to stay in their barracks and continue with their activities, let's not make the mistakes of the past,"" added the coup leader who later went, surrounded of his men, to a studio of Radio Television Guineana (RTG) and, with a flag on his shoulders, launched similar messages. It was unclear where the troops were holding Condé. CBG's 2017 compensation matrix provided for a payment of 1,319,819 GF ($127) for a fully-matured mango tree. After having arrested the president, who is with us right now, we have decided to dissolve the Constitution in force, dissolve the institutions and the Government and close the land and air borders,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Doumbouya in a video recorded in a place unknown and distributed to the media this Sunday morning. Condé's attempts to remain in power at all costs and the establishment of a regime that harasses opponents and critical voices, according to complaints by human rights NGOs, have contributed to plunge the country back into instability. [8] His government in 2011 promulgated a new mining code, which was already in development when he came into office, envisioned to give the Guinean government a greater share of mining revenue and improve governance of the mining sector, including by increasing the transparency of the process through which mining titles are awarded. Eric Humphery-Smith, Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, said: ""For the country's booming mining sector, the situation could not come at a worse time. Where land is acquired for mining, work with clients to ensure that fair compensation is paid to individuals with legal and customary land tenure, including for the value of land. Improve monitoring of mining companies : Strengthen the capacity of government institutions at all levels, particularly the Ministry of the Environment and the Office of Environmental Studies and Evaluation ( Bureau Guinéen d'Etudes et d'Evaluation Environnementale (BGEEE)), to effectively monitor the human rights, social and environmental impact of mining operations. ""We have dissolved government and institutions,"" Doumbouya — a former French foreign legionnaire — said on state television, draped in Guinea's national flag and surrounded by eight other armed soldiers. Human Rights Watch informed interviewees that they could decline to answer questions or could end the interview at any time. On Sunday, September 5, special forces forces occupied the presidential palace after several hours of fighting and detained 83-year-old head of state Alpha Conde  The rebels in uniform are led by Colonel Mamady Dumbuya. Yet after the army statements, the US, UN and the regional body Ecowas swiftly condemned the coup , expressing fears of insecurity and further instability. Human rights standards, however, make clear that where land is expropriated, ""the evicted [person] should be compensated with land commensurate in quality, size and value, or better,"" suggesting that CBG should have found ways to provide communities with alternative land, such as by rehabilitating areas already exploited, or converting areas of unproductive land to farmland. ""CBG only really started paying compensation in 2015,"" said Nestor Fara Leone, the head of the local government's rural development service in Sangaredi. Guinea's president, Alpha Condé, is being held in military detention, according to an elite unit of the army who have led a coup condemned by the international community but welcomed by many in Guinea. subscribe  The Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, strongly condemned the coup , which he called ""the seizure of power by the force of the rifle"" on his Twitter profile, and demanded the immediate release of Condé. ""[91] Where a mining company cannot obtain consent, the mining code does give the state the right to require mining to occur, but only after adequate compensation is paid.

In CBG's case, for example, local officials and community leaders said that for decades the company never paid compensation for land used for mining.

acquiring," Respect rural land rights : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining, fair compensation is paid, including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. Before expropriating land, develop an agreement for returning land to the individuals or communities it is acquired from, including details as to the condition in which land should be returned. Where land is acquired for mining, work with clients to ensure that fair compensation is paid to individuals with legal and customary land tenure, including for the value of land. : Ensure that, where land is acquired for mining, fair compensation is paid, including to individuals and communities with customary land rights, and that land acquisitions do not negatively impact local communities' livelihoods. Work with client companies to ensure that they revisit past land acquisitions that did not meet IFC standards, but which occurred after IFC involvement, including by surveying households in affected villages to determine whether they maintain the same standard of living as before land was acquired for mining. Although much of its infrastructure, including a railway line and the port in Kamsar, was first constructed in the 1960s, CBG's current expansion project means it is now acquiring land for new infrastructure. SMB's cash-for-land approach, for example, which gives farmers one-off financial payments to reflect both the value of land and trees and crops growing it, has allowed the consortium to acquire land quickly to fuel its rapid expansion. By adopting this interpretation, companies can acquire land without the informed consent of those who hold customary land tenure rights and without following a public expropriation process. SMB has since expanded further, acquiring the rights to new mining territory by snapping up licenses from other companies and striking deals with competitors. Ensure that individuals with customary land tenure, and occupants of land who have planted crops or built infrastructure on land, are adequately compensated where land is acquired for mining and that their living standards are not negatively impacted.

Prior to that, the Houthi movement, which began as Zaydi Shiite opposition to the central government's repression of religious minorities and willful underdevelopment of their areas of the country, had little support outside of its traditional power center in northern Yemen.

The suicide bomber detonated the device as Houthi supporters gathered for a rally in the square. ""The Americans did this,"" said Abdullah Youssef, a Houthi supporter who stood guard at the scene of the bombing shortly after the explosion , in what amounts to an escalation of the group's anti-US rhetoric. The Houthis have vowed to eradicate their Sunni rivals, but they have blamed Washington for the Tahrir bombing , claiming the attack was part of a campaign of foreign intervention to destabilise in the country. The explosion underlined the mounting political and security vacuum in Sana'a, which came under Houthi control on 21 September shortly before a peace deal was signed between the group and the government. Explosions were heard on Saturday near the Interior Ministry in the northern part of Sanaa, a day after the Shia fighters began shelling the state television building as they advanced into the city. Yemen will need $6.5 billion between 2014-2017 to cover its budget.Consistent attacks on the country's oil pipelines have severely affected exports. Attacks have increased since the 2011 uprising, which created a power and security vacuum in the country. ""Cash shortages in Yemen occurred in late 2012 due to attacks on oil pipelines,"" said Al-Hamdani. ""The Americans did this,"" said Abdullah Youssef, a Houthi supporter who stood guard at the scene of the bombing shortly after the explosion, in what amounts to an escalation of the group's anti-US rhetoric.

The Tahrir bombing was the latest in a series of AQAP attacks in recent weeks, and many in the capital fear that it will open the floodgates for widespread bloodletting, with the Houthis publicly vowing to attack the group in its southern strongholds. Government officials and analysts believe the attack was the work of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which seized a major military compound in Sana'a in December 2013.

Violence has escalated recently, filling the political vacuum left in January when the Houthis seized the presidential palace and forced Prime Minister Khaled Bahah's government to resign. Only former President Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress party joined the three-day talks aimed at filling the power vacuum left after Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his cabinet resigned on January 22. 21, prompting the government to sign a Peace and National Partnership Agreement with the movement. ADEN (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Yemen's president said they had seized strategic buildings in the southern city of Aden on Monday after a five-hour battle, escalating a civil conflict threatening to split the country in two. ""They believe the Houthi movement … is in control and so long as they hold the president and other figures under house arrest … there's no point in these negotiations ,"" Elshayyal said. ""What is happening now is just one more step toward [the Houthis'] consolidation of power,"" said Abdel-Bari Taher, a veteran Yemeni journalist and writer. In the central Baida province, protesters accused the UN envoy of failing to end Yemen's crisis. The Houthis' growing strength in fractious Yemen has raised fears of sectarian conflict in the poor Arab nation, which has remained in turmoil since a 2011 popular uprising ended the decades-long rule of president Ali Abdullah Saleh one year later.

"" Violence will most likely intensify and blood will be spilled,"" the Yemeni official said. The latest outbreak of violence reportedly followed unsuccessful negotiations that day at the presidential residence between Hadi and a Houthi representative. Saudi Arabia and its allies in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council denounced the Houthis' new governing plan on Saturday as a ""coup"" and called for the United Nations Security Council to bring it to an end , according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. Hook's comments praising the Houthi de- escalation proposal stand in contrast to how he described the Houthis, in a September Wall Street Journal op-ed, as an Iranian proxy group. In this sense, these events do seem like a self-staged coup , even if only by remaining on the sidelines: Hadi and the Gulf states hung Islah out to dry through their neutrality, which had the indirect (but possibly intentional) effect of empowering the Houthis. ""The Houthis' de-escalation proposal , which the Saudis are responding to, shows that Iran clearly does not speak for the Houthis, nor has the best interests of the Yemeni people at heart,"" Hook said.

""We should recall that the Houthis proposed a cessation of missile and air attacks with Saudi Arabia just days after the Iranians struck Saudi oil installations on Sept.

Munassar said the latest development could escalate violence , which could lead to halt of oil production. Yemen's Houthi rebels have begun a ""historic"" meeting with just one party after leaders of the southern separatist movement pulled out of discussions to form a presidential council to end the country's political crisis. However, this type of wider support that goes beyond their Zaydi stronghold is sufficient reason to reject simplistic binary explanations of the conflict as a Shiite versus Sunni sectarianism. He also benefited from this conflict insofar as each party weakened the other and so, as Saleh had done before him, he let the conflicts continue. The GCC also accused the Houthi rebels of thwarting the peaceful political settlement to end the crisis in that Arab country. ""What has been changed, is the Saudis coming out publicly, saying, 'Oh, by the way, we have a dialogue going with the Houthis.'"" ""What has been changed , is the Saudis coming out publicly, saying, 'Oh, by the way, we have a dialogue going with the Houthis.'"" The escalation shattered a tense cease-fire that had held overnight and throughout the morning, after Monday's heavy clashes that engulfed the city, leaving ordinary Yemenis stunned and fearing for their country. In exchange, the Houthis would pull out of Sanaa and put an end to their civil disobedience campaign. special envoy to Yemen Jamal Benomar was now returning to the Yemeni capital Sanaa because of the escalating crisis. ""The Americans did this,"" said Abdullah Youssef, a Houthi supporter who stood guard at the scene of the bombing shortly after the explosion, in what amounts to an escalation of the group's anti-US rhetoric. The dramatic development put the U.S.-backed Hadi into a precarious position and represented the starkest challenge to his authority since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern stronghold and seized the capital in September. After what he described as a deadlock in negotiations with the Houthis, Yemen's President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi resigned his post in January and his cabinet followed in suit. The Houthis accuse Hadi of violating that deal by calling in the current members of the commission to a meeting days ago, prompting the rebels to retaliate and abduct his top aide, Ahmed bin Mubarak, and setting the wheels in motion for the latest violence . The GCC gave repeated warnings against the Houthi advance toward Sanaa just a few weeks ago, and its endorsement of the recent events would seem incoherent if seen outside of the context of regional politics. Hadi, a former general, blamed the Houthis' control of Sanaa for impeding his two-year-long attempt to steer Yemen toward stability after years of secessionist and tribal unrest, deepening poverty and U.S. December 5, 2019  In a shift that analysts said reflects progress in Saudi talks with Yemen's Houthi rebels to end the Yemen war , State Department Iran envoy Brian Hook said today that Iran does not speak for the Houthis, whom he described as playing a more constructive role in issuing a cease-fire proposal.

Monday's violence left at least nine people dead and 67 wounded, Yemen's deputy health minister, Nasser Baoum, said. Yemen's Houthi rebels have begun a ""historic"" meeting with just one party after leaders of the southern separatist movement pulled out of discussions to form a presidential council to end the country's political crisis. ""This could be a card that the southerners can play: using popular power - not military [power] - for future negotiations ."" The progress in Saudi-Houthi dialogue has come as Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, the former Saudi ambassador to the United States and brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has taken the lead on the Yemen file, former diplomats and analysts told Al-Monitor. The Gulf countries also urged the international community to step up its efforts to resolve the crisis and for the United Nations Security Council to implement relevant resolutions. ""And the fact is, you have the Saudis now negotiating with the Houthis."" Tuesday's negotiations at Hadi's residence focused on the shake-up of an 85-member commission tasked with creating an outline of Yemen's future federation, as stated in the draft constitution, Cabinet spokesman Rageh Badi said. A bomb blast tore through Tahrir Square in central Sana'a on Thursday morning, killing dozens of supporters of the Houthi movement that controls the Yemeni capital and fuelling fears of more violence between the Shia group and radical Sunni Islamists. He also, however, refused to sign an annex to the deal that would call for disarmament and withdrawal of Houthi troops. ""The situation is under control and what has happened is being dealt with,"" a Defense Ministry website quoted him as saying. Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Nations have welcomed these developments (although the latter more cautiously), which would have seemed unfathomable just a few weeks ago. Hadi made what seemed at the time to be the strategically smart choice not to intervene in the conflict : Not only did he lack the military power to stop it, but such intervention could easily have exacerbated the situation into a full-blown civil war. SANA, Yemen — Leaders of the Houthi rebels announced on Saturday that they had appointed four key ministers from the recently ousted government to a national security committee, part of their efforts to begin building institutions to replace those disbanded by their effective coup . Munassar said the latest development could escalate violence , which could lead to halt of oil production.
