They were believed to be armed and supported in part by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. When the power struggles in Dushanbe led to civil unrest and violent conflict, national-level elites and local powerbrokers mobilised support from the local level, drawing on and appealing to ties of identity, shared economic concerns and common security dilemmas. They reportedly enjoy the support of former UTO field commanders, with whom they fought as allies during the civil war.

The unicameral legislature offers decisive majority support for Rahmonov's programs, and the judiciary is fully under the control of the president, who has the power to dismiss any judge. Instead of leading an effort to punish all parties guilty of crimes during and after the civil war, the government imprisoned during the year at least nineteen people who supported the DPT-IRP coalition. In the campaign, apparently coordinated with Moscow, Tajikistani troops moved with Russian air support eastward into the country's narrow central corridor toward opposition strongholds. Most of these parties identified themselves by ideology, (e.g., promoting 'democracy' or 'Islamic values' or a revitalised 'Tajik nation') but drew their support from a particular region. [Source: Library of Congress, March 1996 *]  The Popular Front — the pro-government, neo-Communists — was supported by the Kulyabi clan from the south and the clan from Khujand region in the north, which had good relations with the Soviet elite. Until 1998 the UTO enjoyed the support of the pre-Taliban government in Afghanistan, in particular President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his defense minister, the late Gen. The conflict was the culmination of a power struggle between a communist-led government that was dominated by people from Leninabad (known as ""Leninabadis""), and an opposition coalition that drew support primarily from people whose origins were from the northeast (""Gharmis"") and Gorno-Badakhshan (""Pamiris""). The conflict was the culmination of a power struggle between a communist-led government that was dominated by people from Leninabad (known as ""Leninabadis""), and an opposition coalition that drew support primarily from people whose origins were from the northeast (""Gharmis"") and Gorno-Badakhshan (""Pamiris""). Former UTO members occupy senior positions in the government, and the IRP enjoys parliamentary representation, but in practice these officials and parliamentary deputies support official policy and the president on almost all points. The government has arrested scores of members of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), an Islamic group that supports the reestablishment of the Caliphate, or Islamic state, for Muslims by peaceful means. The disappeared were principally individuals who supported the DPT-IRP coalition or who were of Pamiri or Garmi origins. The Islamic forces, was supported mainly by the Garmis (or Garms) from the remote southern province of Garm, the Pamiris (Badakhshans) from the Pamir region of Gorno-Badakhshan and clans from the Kurgan-Tyube valley. Since September 11, Russia has increased its material support for the United Front delivered via the Dushanbe airport. The unicameral legislature offers decisive majority support for Rahmonov's programs, and the judiciary is fully under the control of the president, who has the power to dismiss any judge. He said the UN had lost four of its members when ""they were performing their duties, their mandate, working with full responsibility, supporting peace and stability in this country"". The Islamic forces, was supported mainly by the Garmis (or Garms) from the remote southern province of Garm, the Pamiris (Badakhshans) from the Pamir region of Gorno-Badakhshan and clans from the Kurgan-Tyube valley. The government was supported in the civil war by people from Kuliab (""Kuliabis),"" a district in the southern Khatlon province. This issue was to be decided by the people's deputies themselves, so this proposal received the support of only 15 deputies during the voting. The pro-Communist Tajikistan government was armed with tanks, armored personnel carriers and weapons and supplies brought in on Russian supply lines and logistical support . Further, the 201st Motorized Rifle Division played a strategic role in the civil war by providing material support to the Kuliabi-based paramilitary groups. Most of these parties identified themselves by ideology, (e.g., promoting 'democracy' or 'Islamic values' or a revitalised 'Tajik nation') but drew their support from a particular region.

abuse," Abuses since UNTAC (1993-Present)  After the departure of UNTAC in 1993, CPP political violence flared again, including against media critics and the new opposition Khmer Nation Party led by former FUNCINPEC finance minister Sam Rainsy, who was the target of a number of assassination attempts. This danger should be viewed both in light of their long records of violating human rights and in the context of the 2013 national elections and those scheduled for 2018. The report listed hundreds of other cases of SOC abuses , including enforced disappearances and torture. Kieng Savut had a notorious reputation as a CPP henchman and serious human rights abuser . We find it especially disturbing that such grave abuses should occur in the very same week that your officials had invited Amnesty International to visit Cambodia for discussions on human rights with you and other government representatives. They undertook to ""promote and encourage respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cambodia as embodied in the relevant international instruments in order, in particular, to prevent the recurrence of human rights abuses "". This report details the responsibility of 12 of these senior security force officers for human rights abuses in Cambodia from the late 1970s until the present:  Gen. Khmer Rouge-era Abuses The two generals with the longest known records of human rights abuses are Pol Saroeun and Kun Kim. All 12 owe their senior positions in the security forces to personal links to Hun Sen dating back two decades or more, and their willingness to abuse human rights. Khmer Rouge-era Abuses  The two generals with the longest known records of human rights abuses are Pol Saroeun and Kun Kim. Most of the 12 have been implicated in the use of unnecessary, excessive, and sometimes lethal force against protests about unfree and unfair elections, land confiscations, labor abuses , and low wages. For the same reasons, despite gathering evidence of widespread human rights abuses , UNTAC could not penetrate the wall of official impunity. Ten of the 12 officials profiled here are implicated in these abuses via their service in various PRK and SOC (successor to the PRK) political, military, intelligence, and police units, the institutional bases from which they rose to their current prominent security force positions. Many have also been involved in non-political abuses against the ordinary population, such as land takings, murder, torture, and arbitrary detention. Given their past record and current positions, Hun Sen can rely upon these 12 commanders and their subordinates to commit human rights abuses whenever it is considered necessary, including for their own power and economic interests. These abuses were sometimes conducted in coordination with the army and ordinary police in PRK ""mixed force"" formations. We find it especially disturbing that such grave abuses should occur in the very same week that your officials had invited Amnesty International to visit Cambodia for discussions on human rights with you and other government representatives. Instructions to the armed forces to act against the opposition were repeated, at times in even more threatening tones, in 2016, especially after small civil society-led peaceful protests in May against the politically motivated arrest and charging of five human rights defenders in connection with activities aimed at opposing human rights violations . PRK-era and SOC Period Abuses The policies and practices of the Khmer Rouge devastated Cambodian society and created conditions for the success of the Vietnamese invasion in December 1978 and the creation of the PRK in January 1979. It is tragic that the gains made through the transition process in Cambodia should be placed at risk in this way, that ordinary Cambodians are yet again suffering violations of their fundamental human rights, and that developments in Cambodia have again become a threat to stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. You know only too well the spectre of gross human rights violations that haunts Cambodia to this day. The abuses in which the 12 are implicated include violations of human rights, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed from the 1970s to the present. It also appears to violate article 9 of Cambodia's Law on the General Status of Military Personnel of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (1997), which states that ""[m]ilitary personnel shall be neutral in their functions and work activities, and the use of functions/titles and the state's materials for serving any political activities shall be prohibited."" Abuses committed during repression of rising popular dissatisfaction with the PRK and its reliance on Vietnamese backers include arbitrary political detention and routine torture in a provincial prison run under the authority of Pol Saroeun when he was governor there; in the municipal prison of the capital, Phnom Penh, when Neth Savoeun was a senior police officer there; and in the political security apparatus of the Ministry of Interior when Sok Phal was an important cadre there. UNTAC-era Abuses In October 1991, SOC, FUNCINPEC, a second non-communist opposition group (the Khmer People's National Liberation Front), and Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge signed the Paris ""Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict,"" which was also signed by 18 foreign governments. Since then Hun Sen and the CPP have launched an escalating campaign of human rights violations targeting the CNRP and Cambodian media and civil society, claiming this is necessary to prevent any ""color revolution"" that it says might otherwise occur in connection with the 2018 elections, including as a result of protests against fraud.",A0_pag_abuser,capital,A1_ppt_entity_abused,capital

This announcement was backed up by the United States' decision to suspend its aid to Cambodia for a period of 30 days as well as sanctions imposed by other countries.

Access to Remedies  Community leaders told Human Rights Watch that mining companies often do not promptly or meaningfully respond to their complaints about the impacts of bauxite mining on their land, livelihoods, health and water sources. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured.

Improve transparency: Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining. Damage to water sources that residents attribute to mining, as well as increased demand due to population migration to mining sites, reduces communities' access to water for drinking, washing and cooking. NRGI defined it, ""a natural resource-backed loan is a mechanism by which a country can access funds in exchange for future flows of income from its natural resources, such as oil or minerals, or in exchange for repayment guarantees made up of these resources"".

Require that affected communities have access to independent legal advice when environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) are conducted by companies and reviewed by the Guinean government. Communities in the Boké region also told Human Rights Watch that the expropriation of land for mining or mining infrastructure had prevented communities from accessing streams and natural springs where they previously found water, while an influx of people seeking jobs in mines increased pressure on remaining water resources.

Although women are acutely impacted by loss of land to mining, reduced access to water, and concerns over health, strong social norms that discourage women from equal participation in village governance mean that women face barriers in lodging complaints. If necessary for public health or to protect access to water, suspend mining activities until the problem has been addressed. Reduced Access to Water  Unless managed appropriately, studies show that bauxite mining will have significant impacts on the hydrology of the surrounding landscape. Improve the access of affected communities and civil society organizations to key documents, from the government and mining companies, related to the human rights, social and environmental impacts of bauxite mining. Monitor and protect access to clean water: Follow international best practices to prevent or mitigate the impact of mining on access to water, and monitor the impact of mining on water levels and quality. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. Mining companies underscore that there are multiple reasons for inadequate access to water in the Boké region, including population migration, climate change-related factors and the aridity of the area, particularly in the dry season. Scores of residents told Human Rights Watch that they believe that mining had reduced water levels and quality in the local rivers, streams and wells that they rely on for washing, cooking and drinking, threatening the access to water of thousands of people. Immediately end any activities that have been shown to prevent communities accessing adequate water for their needs, until access to water has been secured. Where government or company monitoring suggests mining is impacting access to clean water, ensure companies take immediate steps to address the cause.",A0_pag_accessor,CBG,A1_ppt_thing_accessed,CBG

objection," This by no means implies universal support, because in addition to the armed opposition to them, many Yemenis are worried that the Houthis will force a Zaydi rule and be as repressive toward the rest of Yemen as they have been reported to be in areas already under their control. This was achieved not by an absence of opposition - opposition to the government has always existed in Yemen, even in its most extreme, armed, form - but through the relative stability of the balance of power between opposed forces. Prior to that, the Houthi movement, which began as Zaydi Shiite opposition to the central government's repression of religious minorities and willful underdevelopment of their areas of the country, had little support outside of its traditional power center in northern Yemen. The Houthis, therefore, claim the support of their own Zaydi constituency and their allies in the Southern movement, as well as vast numbers of Yemenis who view them as a real opposition to the elites that is untainted by corruption. This was achieved not by an absence of opposition - opposition to the government has always existed in Yemen, even in its most extreme, armed, form - but through the relative stability of the balance of power between opposed forces.
